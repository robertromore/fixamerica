# Rural Infrastructure: Legislation

## Overview

Rural infrastructure investment requires legislation that transcends the traditional siloed approach of separate programs for broadband, roads, water, and community facilities. The legislative framework presented here establishes a centralized financing mechanism, pairs broadband deployment with agricultural logistics, and integrates climate-resilient water systems with community infrastructure. This coordinated strategy reflects the reality that rural infrastructure challenges are interconnected: a community without broadband cannot adopt precision agriculture, a region without cold storage cannot reduce food waste, and a county without healthcare or childcare cannot retain the workforce its farms depend on.

The legislative approach rests on three pillars. First, the Rural Infrastructure Resilience Bank Act creates a federally chartered institution to mobilize low-cost capital at scale, replacing the fragmented landscape of dozens of separate grant and loan programs with a unified financing entity that requires resilience and equity criteria. Second, the Broadband and Agricultural Logistics Corridor Act links digital infrastructure to physical supply chain investments, recognizing that fiber deployment is most cost-effective when bundled with cold storage, aggregation, and freight improvements along shared corridors. Third, the Climate-Ready Water and Community Infrastructure Act addresses the intertwined crises of aging water systems, rural hospital closures, childcare deserts, and workforce housing shortages by embedding climate adaptation into all community infrastructure investment.

Congress has ample authority under the Spending Clause and Commerce Clause to enact this framework. The bills are designed as Farm Bill title additions or stand-alone authorizations, structured to work within existing USDA, DOT, NTIA, and EPA program architectures while consolidating coordination through new mechanisms.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for rural infrastructure reform. Congress has well-established authority under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) to fund infrastructure for the general welfare, and under the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) to regulate and support infrastructure that facilitates interstate commerce in agricultural products. Federal infrastructure programs dating to the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 provide extensive precedent.*

## Federal Legislation

### The Rural Infrastructure Resilience Bank Act

**Purpose**: To establish a federally chartered Rural Infrastructure Resilience Bank (RIRB) that provides low-cost loans, credit enhancements, grants, and technical assistance for integrated rural infrastructure projects meeting resilience, equity, and maintenance sustainability criteria.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Bank Establishment**: Creates the RIRB as an independent government-sponsored enterprise with $25 billion in initial federal capitalization and authority to issue bonds leveraging up to 10 times its capital base.
2. **Eligible Projects**: Defines eligible infrastructure broadly to include broadband, transportation, water, energy, healthcare facilities, housing, childcare centers, and agricultural logistics.
3. **Resilience Scoring**: Requires all funded projects to meet climate resilience standards addressing flood, drought, heat, and wildfire risk, with scoring criteria developed in coordination with NOAA and FEMA.
4. **Equity Priority**: Mandates that at least 40 percent of annual lending and grant volume flow to tribal nations, persistent poverty counties, and historically underserved communities.
5. **Maintenance Escrow**: Requires borrowers to establish maintenance escrow accounts funded at 3 percent of project cost annually as a condition of financing.

AN ACT

To establish the Rural Infrastructure Resilience Bank to provide financing, technical assistance, and coordination for integrated rural infrastructure investments.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Rural Infrastructure Resilience Bank Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Approximately 25 percent of rural residents lack access to broadband at speeds of 100/20 Mbps, limiting precision agriculture and economic opportunity (FCC Broadband Deployment Report, 2023).
(2) More than 40,000 rural bridges are in poor or structurally deficient condition, constraining agricultural freight movement (FHWA National Bridge Inventory, 2023).
(3) More than 140 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, and over 600 additional facilities are at financial risk (Chartis Center for Rural Health, 2024).
(4) The Bureau of Indian Affairs road and facility maintenance backlog exceeds $3 billion (BIA, 2023).
(5) Fragmented federal programs across USDA, DOT, NTIA, EPA, HUD, and HHS create duplicative application processes and coordination failures that disadvantage small rural communities lacking grant-writing capacity.
(6) Thirty-three states operate state infrastructure banks that have demonstrated the ability to accelerate project deployment and leverage private capital (FHWA, 2023).

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Creates a dedicated institution modeled on successful state infrastructure banks and the Farm Credit System, solving the coordination problem by housing multi-sector financing under one roof with professional management and regional presence.
- **Section 5**: The 10x leverage ratio enables $250 billion in total lending capacity from $25 billion in public capital, maximizing the return on federal investment while below-market rates ensure affordability.
- **Section 6**: The resilience scoring system prevents the common failure of building infrastructure to historical standards that cannot withstand future climate conditions, while the maintenance escrow directly addresses the chronic deferred maintenance problem.
- **Section 7**: The 40 percent equity target and tribal direct-funding provisions address the structural disadvantage that small, underserved communities face in competitive grant programs where grant-writing capacity determines outcomes.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Board confirmation and organizational stand-up | 180 days after enactment | President / Senate |
| Regional office establishment | 1 year after enactment | RIRB Board |
| Resilience scoring system development | 1 year after enactment | RIRB / NOAA / FEMA |
| MOUs with existing federal agencies | 180 days after enactment | RIRB Board |
| First lending and grant cycle | 18 months after enactment | RIRB |

**Challenges**:

- **Governance Complexity**: A 9-member board with multiple appointing authorities risks slow decision-making and political gridlock; clear delegation of operational authority to a CEO is essential.
- **Coordination with Existing Programs**: USDA Rural Development, NTIA, and DOT each have established constituencies that may resist a new coordinating entity perceived as competition.
- **Capitalization Sustainability**: The initial $25 billion requires a significant one-time appropriation; Congress may reduce the figure, undermining the leverage model.

**Refinements**:

- Include a statutory requirement that the Bank's CEO have prior experience in rural development finance, insulating operations from political appointments.
- Phase initial lending through pilot corridors to demonstrate the model before scaling nationally.

### The Broadband and Agricultural Logistics Corridor Act

**Purpose**: To fund integrated corridor investments combining broadband deployment, cold storage, aggregation facilities, and freight improvements in designated agricultural corridors, reducing deployment costs through co-construction and eliminating supply chain chokepoints.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Corridor Designation**: Authorizes USDA, in coordination with NTIA and DOT, to designate up to 50 Agricultural Logistics Corridors based on agricultural production volume, broadband gaps, and food loss data.
2. **Multi-Modal Grants**: Provides competitive grants for projects that bundle at least two infrastructure types (broadband, cold storage, freight, processing) within designated corridors.
3. **Short-Line Railroad Rehabilitation**: Dedicates funding for short-line railroad upgrades within corridors to handle 286,000-pound railcar weights.
4. **Middle-Mile Fiber**: Funds backbone fiber along transportation rights-of-way within corridors, with open-access requirements enabling competitive last-mile service.
5. **Dig-Once Requirements**: Mandates conduit installation during any federally funded road or utility project within designated corridors.

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To establish Agricultural Logistics Corridors combining broadband, cold storage, and freight investments to strengthen rural supply chains.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Broadband and Agricultural Logistics Corridor Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Approximately 30 to 40 percent of food produced in the United States is wasted, with cold chain gaps and logistics failures contributing significantly to post-harvest loss (USDA ERS, 2023).
(2) More than 70 percent of farm products move by truck, yet rural road conditions and bridge weight restrictions force costly detours (USDA ERS; FHWA, 2023).
(3) Short-line railroads operate 47,000 miles of track serving the majority of grain elevators, yet many lines cannot accommodate modern 286,000-pound railcars (ASLRRA, 2023).
(4) The BEAD program allocates $42.45 billion for broadband deployment, but separate administration from agricultural logistics programs misses opportunities for co-construction and cost savings (NTIA, 2023).
(5) Co-deployment of fiber and utilities along transportation rights-of-way can reduce broadband deployment costs by 30 to 50 percent (GAO, 2022).

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) AGRICULTURAL LOGISTICS CORRIDOR.—The term "Agricultural Logistics Corridor" means a geographic area designated under section 4 that encompasses major agricultural production zones, transportation routes, and broadband-underserved areas.
(2) CO-CONSTRUCTION.—The term "co-construction" means the simultaneous installation of two or more infrastructure types (such as fiber-optic cable and water or electrical conduit) within a shared trench, right-of-way, or construction project.
(3) COLD CHAIN.—The term "cold chain" means the temperature-controlled supply chain required to maintain the quality and safety of perishable agricultural products from harvest to consumer.
(4) ELIGIBLE APPLICANT.—The term "eligible applicant" means a State, county, tribal government, cooperative, port authority, short-line railroad, broadband provider, nonprofit food hub, or public-private partnership.

SEC. 4. CORRIDOR DESIGNATION.

(a) DESIGNATION AUTHORITY.—The Secretary of Agriculture, in coordination with the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information and the Secretary of Transportation, shall designate not more than 50 Agricultural Logistics Corridors.
(b) CRITERIA.—Corridors shall be designated based on:
    (1) agricultural production volume and diversity;
    (2) severity of broadband gaps;
    (3) documented food loss and cold chain deficiencies;
    (4) transportation bottlenecks and bridge weight restrictions;
    (5) presence of tribal lands or persistent poverty counties; and
    (6) potential for co-construction cost savings.
(c) TRIBAL CORRIDORS.—Not fewer than 5 corridors shall include significant tribal agricultural lands.
(d) TIMELINE.—Initial corridor designations shall be completed within 1 year of enactment.

SEC. 5. MULTI-MODAL CORRIDOR GRANTS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall award competitive grants to eligible applicants for projects within designated corridors that combine at least 2 of the following:
    (1) broadband deployment (fiber or fixed wireless);
    (2) cold storage or aggregation facility construction;
    (3) road or bridge improvement;
    (4) short-line railroad rehabilitation; and
    (5) small-scale processing facility construction.
(b) PRIORITY.—Priority shall be given to applications demonstrating:
    (1) integration of 3 or more infrastructure types;
    (2) co-construction or shared right-of-way arrangements;
    (3) participation by small and mid-sized agricultural producers;
    (4) tribal government partnership; and
    (5) climate resilience design.
(c) FEDERAL SHARE.—The Federal share of a project cost shall not exceed 80 percent, except that the Federal share for tribal governments and persistent poverty counties shall not exceed 95 percent.

SEC. 6. SHORT-LINE RAILROAD REHABILITATION.

(a) DEDICATED FUNDING.—There is authorized $3,000,000,000 over fiscal years 2027 through 2031 for short-line railroad rehabilitation within designated corridors.
(b) WEIGHT CAPACITY.—Priority shall be given to projects that upgrade track to accommodate 286,000-pound railcar weights.
(c) MATCHING.—Short-line railroads shall provide a 20 percent match, which may include in-kind contributions.

SEC. 7. MIDDLE-MILE BROADBAND AND DIG-ONCE POLICY.

(a) MIDDLE-MILE GRANTS.—The Secretary, in coordination with NTIA, shall fund middle-mile fiber backbone construction along transportation rights-of-way within designated corridors.
(b) OPEN ACCESS.—Middle-mile infrastructure funded under this section shall be operated on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis, allowing competitive last-mile providers to connect.
(c) DIG-ONCE.—Any federally funded road, bridge, water, or utility construction project within a designated corridor shall include installation of broadband conduit, unless the Secretary determines that such installation is not technically feasible.

SEC. 8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) ANNUAL REPORT.—Not later than 1 year after the first corridor designation, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on:
    (1) the number and geographic distribution of designated corridors;
    (2) grant awards by project type and applicant category;
    (3) broadband speeds achieved and households connected;
    (4) cold storage capacity added and estimated food loss reduction;
    (5) short-line railroad miles upgraded; and
    (6) private investment leveraged.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $2,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $3,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $3,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $3,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $3,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: The corridor designation process replaces the current approach of funding individual projects in isolation, enabling regional planning that identifies where broadband, cold storage, and freight investments can be co-located for maximum impact and minimum cost.
- **Section 5**: Multi-modal grants incentivize applicants to bundle infrastructure types, producing the cost savings of co-construction and the synergy of integrated systems (e.g., broadband-connected cold storage enables real-time inventory management).
- **Section 6**: Dedicated short-line railroad funding addresses the critical bottleneck that many grain elevators and agricultural facilities sit on track that cannot handle modern railcar weights, forcing expensive truck transport.
- **Section 7**: The dig-once requirement prevents the costly mistake of tearing up roads to install fiber years after a road project, while open-access middle-mile prevents monopoly control of backbone infrastructure.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Interagency corridor designation criteria | 180 days after enactment | USDA / NTIA / DOT |
| Initial corridor designations (first 25) | 1 year after enactment | USDA |
| First round of multi-modal grant awards | 18 months after enactment | USDA |
| Short-line rehabilitation grants | 1 year after enactment | USDA / FRA |
| Remaining corridor designations | 2 years after enactment | USDA |

**Challenges**:

- **Multi-Agency Coordination**: USDA, NTIA, and DOT each operate under different authorizing statutes and appropriations subcommittees, creating jurisdictional friction that could delay corridor designation.
- **Rights-of-Way**: Securing shared rights-of-way across private land, railroad easements, and public highways requires navigating complex legal and regulatory barriers.

**Refinements**:

- Designate USDA as the lead agency with binding coordination authority over NTIA and DOT for corridor-related decisions, avoiding interagency gridlock.
- Include a categorical exclusion from NEPA for broadband conduit installation within existing transportation rights-of-way to accelerate deployment.

### The Climate-Ready Water and Community Infrastructure Act

**Purpose**: To modernize rural water systems (irrigation, drainage, drinking water, flood control) and community infrastructure (healthcare, housing, childcare, transit) with integrated climate adaptation requirements, addressing the intertwined crises of aging water infrastructure, rural service deserts, and climate vulnerability.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Watershed Resilience Program**: Establishes a competitive grant program for watershed-scale water infrastructure modernization incorporating climate projections.
2. **Rural Hospital and Healthcare Stabilization**: Provides capital grants for critical access hospitals, telehealth infrastructure, and community health centers.
3. **Childcare and Community Facilities**: Dedicates funding for childcare center construction, workforce housing, and multi-use community facilities in rural areas.
4. **Rural Transit Innovation**: Funds demand-responsive transit, vanpool programs, and electric vehicle infrastructure linking agricultural workers to employment centers.
5. **Climate Adaptation Standards**: Requires all funded projects to incorporate forward-looking climate data and meet resilience benchmarks.

**Draft Text**:

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To modernize rural water infrastructure and community facilities with climate resilience standards to sustain agricultural production and rural communities.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Climate-Ready Water and Community Infrastructure Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The majority of Bureau of Reclamation irrigation infrastructure is more than 50 years old and was designed for historical climate conditions that no longer reflect current precipitation variability (Bureau of Reclamation, 2023).
(2) More than 15,000 dams classified as high-hazard-potential have identified safety deficiencies requiring remediation (ASCE Infrastructure Report Card, 2021).
(3) Rural water systems serving fewer than 10,000 people experience higher rates of Safe Drinking Water Act violations than urban systems (EPA, 2023).
(4) More than 140 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, and 60 percent of rural counties qualify as childcare deserts (Chartis Center, 2024; CCAoA, 2023).
(5) The rural road fatality rate is twice the urban rate, partly due to lack of safe transit alternatives for agricultural workers (NHTSA, 2023).
(6) Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of drought, flooding, and extreme heat events that damage rural infrastructure and reduce agricultural productivity (NOAA, 2024).

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) CLIMATE ADAPTATION STANDARD.—The term "climate adaptation standard" means a design requirement based on forward-looking climate projections (minimum 30-year horizon) rather than historical climate data alone.

SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: The watershed-scale approach prevents the common failure of upgrading one segment of a water system while neglecting upstream or downstream components, requiring coordinated planning that matches the physical reality of how water systems function.
- **Section 5**: Capital grants for critical access hospitals address the immediate closure crisis, while telehealth infrastructure investment provides a sustainable long-term model for rural healthcare delivery that does not depend on maintaining a full-service hospital in every community.
- **Section 6**: Co-locating childcare with workforce housing and community facilities produces efficiencies that make all three more viable; a standalone childcare center in a rural area may fail, but one co-located with a health clinic and housing development creates a self-reinforcing community anchor.
- **Section 8**: Requiring forward-looking climate data rather than historical averages prevents the repeated pattern of building infrastructure that fails within its design life because conditions have changed.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Publish Climate Adaptation Standards | 1 year after enactment | USDA / NOAA |
| First watershed resilience grants | 18 months after enactment | USDA / Reclamation |
| Rural hospital stabilization grants | 1 year after enactment | HHS |
| Childcare construction grants | 1 year after enactment | USDA Rural Development |
| Rural transit pilot programs | 18 months after enactment | DOT |

**Challenges**:

- **Scale of Need**: The combined water, healthcare, childcare, housing, and transit needs vastly exceed the authorized appropriations; prioritization will be contentious.
- **Climate Standards Resistance**: Requiring forward-looking climate data may face political opposition from those who dispute climate projections or view the requirements as adding unnecessary cost.
- **Fragmented Jurisdiction**: Water, healthcare, housing, childcare, and transit fall under different federal agencies and congressional committees, complicating legislative passage.

**Refinements**:

- Structure the bill as amendments to existing Farm Bill titles and infrastructure programs to leverage established committee jurisdiction and reduce the number of congressional committees required for passage.
- Include a waiver authority allowing the Secretary to reduce the climate adaptation standard for projects in communities demonstrating extreme financial hardship, while requiring a plan to achieve full compliance within 10 years.

**Purpose**: To enable multi-jurisdictional rural infrastructure planning and investment by authorizing interstate and inter-county compacts for broadband, water, transit, and community facility coordination.

**Adaptability Notes**: States with many small counties (such as those in the Great Plains and Appalachia) benefit most from compact authority. States with strong county home-rule provisions may need to address local government consent requirements. Western states should incorporate water rights coordination. States with restrictive municipal broadband laws should include provisions preempting those restrictions for compact entities.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Rural Infrastructure Compact Act".

SECTION 2. COMPACT AUTHORIZATION.
(a) Two or more counties, municipalities, tribal governments, special districts,
    or rural electric cooperatives may form a Rural Infrastructure Compact for
    the purpose of jointly planning, financing, constructing, and maintaining
    infrastructure serving rural areas.
(b) Compact entities may include broadband, transportation, water, energy,
    healthcare, childcare, and housing within their scope.

SECTION 3. GOVERNANCE.
(a) Each Compact shall be governed by a board consisting of one representative
    from each participating jurisdiction.
(b) The board may hire professional staff, adopt bylaws, and enter into
    contracts.
(c) Decisions requiring expenditure of funds shall be by two-thirds vote.

SECTION 4. FINANCING AUTHORITY.
(a) A Compact may issue revenue bonds secured by user fees, assessments,
    or intergovernmental transfers.
(b) A Compact may apply for and receive Federal and State grants on behalf
    of participating jurisdictions.
(c) A Compact may establish a shared maintenance fund with annual
    contributions from each participating jurisdiction.

SECTION 5. STATE MATCHING FUNDS.
The [State Department of Rural Development / Commerce / Agriculture] shall
provide matching funds of up to 25 percent of total project cost for
infrastructure projects undertaken by a duly formed Compact, with priority
for projects serving persistent poverty areas or tribal lands within the State.

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: USDA Rural Development, with coordination responsibilities shared among NTIA, DOT (Federal Highway Administration, Federal Transit Administration, Federal Railroad Administration), EPA, HHS, and the Department of the Interior (Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Indian Affairs).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Resilience Scoring System**: The RIRB, in coordination with NOAA and FEMA, must develop and publish a quantitative resilience scoring methodology applicable across infrastructure types. Deadline: 1 year after Bank establishment.
2. **Agricultural Logistics Corridor Designation Criteria**: USDA, NTIA, and DOT must jointly publish criteria for corridor designation, including production volume thresholds, broadband gap metrics, and food loss indicators. Deadline: 180 days after enactment of the Corridor Act.
3. **Climate Adaptation Standards for Rural Infrastructure**: USDA and NOAA must publish minimum climate adaptation design standards for flood, drought, heat, and wildfire. Deadline: 1 year after enactment of the Water and Community Infrastructure Act.
4. **Dig-Once Implementation Guidance**: DOT and NTIA must publish technical guidance for conduit installation during federally funded road and utility projects, including specifications, cost allocation, and exemption criteria. Deadline: 180 days after enactment.
5. **Maintenance Escrow Requirements**: The RIRB must publish rules governing maintenance escrow account establishment, contribution rates, permitted withdrawals, and enforcement actions for non-compliance. Deadline: 1 year after Bank establishment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: Broadband providers receiving corridor grants that fail to meet service obligations (speed, uptime, open-access) face penalties of up to $100,000 per violation per day. Infrastructure bank borrowers that fail to maintain escrow accounts face accelerated repayment and debarment.
- **Administrative Actions**: Non-compliant grant recipients face clawback of federal funds, debarment from future programs, and referral to the Inspector General. Corridor designations may be revoked for regions failing to meet deployment timelines.
- **Private Right of Action**: Communities within designated corridors that do not receive committed broadband service within 3 years of grant award may bring suit in federal court to compel performance or return of funds.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

The proposed legislation rests on well-established constitutional authority. The **Spending Clause** (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) provides Congress broad power to tax and spend for the general welfare, which has supported rural infrastructure programs since the New Deal era. Conditions attached to federal funding (resilience standards, equity targets, maintenance requirements) are permissible under *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), as they are unambiguous, related to the federal interest, and do not coerce states. The **Commerce Clause** supports regulation of broadband, transportation, and agricultural supply chains that cross state lines. The creation of a government-sponsored enterprise (the RIRB) follows the precedent of the Farm Credit System, Fannie Mae, and the Tennessee Valley Authority.

The **dig-once** requirement raises potential Fifth Amendment concerns if it imposes costs on state or local governments undertaking road projects. However, because it applies only to federally funded projects, it functions as a condition of federal spending rather than a regulatory taking.

### Preemption

Federal legislation sets a floor, not a ceiling, for rural infrastructure standards. States may enact stricter resilience standards, higher broadband speed requirements, or more generous equity targets. The corridor designation process is federal but implementation relies on state and local cooperation. The Model Rural Infrastructure Compact Act preserves state authority over local government formation and bonding. Federal broadband provisions do not preempt state public utility regulation, but the open-access requirement for middle-mile infrastructure funded under the Corridor Act does preempt state laws that would prohibit open-access terms for federally funded networks.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is monitored through three mechanisms: (1) the RIRB's annual reporting on resilience scores, equity targets, and maintenance escrow balances; (2) USDA and NTIA oversight of corridor grant performance, including broadband speed testing and cold storage utilization data; and (3) the private right of action allowing affected communities to enforce broadband service commitments in federal court. GAO is authorized to conduct periodic audits of all three legislative programs.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **Maintenance Escrow Manipulation** | Borrowers establish escrow accounts but draw down funds for non-maintenance purposes, leaving infrastructure unmaintained. | High | Require third-party escrow management and annual independent audits; restrict withdrawals to verified maintenance expenditures only. |
| **Corridor Overstatement** | Applicants inflate coverage metrics or claim broadband service to areas already served to qualify for corridor grants. | High | Use FCC Broadband Data Collection maps verified by speed testing; require challenge processes allowing residents to dispute coverage claims. |
| **Shadow Broadband Builds** | Entities receive corridor grants but lease operations to third-party ISPs with no enforceable service obligations, avoiding performance accountability. | Medium | Require service level agreements as a condition of grant; make the grant recipient jointly liable with any operational subcontractor. |
| **Equity Target Gaming** | The Bank directs loans to projects nominally serving persistent poverty counties but primarily benefiting adjacent non-qualifying areas. | Medium | Define "serving" as requiring that 60 percent or more of direct beneficiaries reside within qualifying geographies; conduct post-award geographic impact analysis. |
| **Resilience Score Shopping** | Applicants engineer project designs to barely meet the minimum resilience score without genuine climate adaptation. | Medium | Establish tiered scoring with preferential interest rates for higher scores, creating a market incentive to exceed minimums; require third-party resilience audits. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Workforce Scarcity** | Limited local construction crews delay project timelines and increase costs; rural areas lack fiber technicians, lineworkers, and water system operators. | Aging workforce, limited rural training pipelines, competition from urban construction markets. | Fund rural infrastructure workforce academies and registered apprenticeship programs; require workforce development plans in all Bank and corridor grant applications. |
| **Data Gaps** | Lack of real-time infrastructure condition data prevents effective prioritization and maintenance scheduling. | Fragmented state and local reporting systems; no standardized rural infrastructure condition database. | Require digital asset management systems as a condition of Bank financing; fund a national rural infrastructure condition database. |
| **Appropriations Risk** | Authorization levels may not be matched by actual appropriations, undermining program scale and predictability. | Annual appropriations process is subject to political dynamics unrelated to rural infrastructure needs. | Structure the RIRB's bond authority so that initial capitalization enables self-sustaining operations; include advance appropriations for the first 3 years. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Maintenance Accountability**: Amend the Bank's charter to require annual third-party infrastructure condition assessments for all projects exceeding $5 million, with automatic interest rate increases for borrowers whose assets fall below established condition thresholds.
2. **Broadband Verification**: Mandate quarterly speed testing at randomly selected locations within corridor grant areas, with results published on a public dashboard; trigger clawback proceedings if measured speeds fall below 80 percent of committed levels for two consecutive quarters.
3. **Workforce Pipeline**: Require all Bank borrowers and corridor grant recipients to submit workforce development plans demonstrating how they will recruit, train, and retain the workers needed to build and maintain funded infrastructure, with a preference for local hiring.
4. **Equity Audits**: Commission an independent biennial audit of the Bank's equity target compliance, including geographic analysis of where funds flow relative to persistent poverty counties and tribal lands, with results reported directly to Congress.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **Rural Infrastructure Resilience Bank**: Subject to reauthorization every 10 years; GAO audit of financial condition, lending portfolio, and equity compliance required in years 5 and 9.
- **Agricultural Logistics Corridors**: Corridor designations subject to 5-year review; corridors that have achieved deployment targets may be redesignated to areas of greater need.
- **Climate Adaptation Standards**: Mandatory update every 5 years to incorporate the most recent NOAA climate projections and IPCC assessment reports.
- **All Programs**: The Comptroller General shall submit to Congress a comprehensive evaluation of all three Acts not later than 7 years after enactment, with recommendations for reauthorization, modification, or consolidation.
