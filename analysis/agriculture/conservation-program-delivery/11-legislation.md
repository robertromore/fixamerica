# Conservation Program Delivery: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative package for conservation program delivery focuses on modernizing data, expanding equitable access, and mobilizing private capital so that federal spending achieves measurable soil, water, and climate outcomes. It builds on NRCS core programs (EQIP, CSP, RCPP) and aligns delivery standards across USDA agencies.

## Model Federal Bills

### 1. Conservation Delivery Modernization Act

**Purpose**: Establish a shared data platform, mandate interoperable performance reporting, and condition some payments on third-party verification of outcomes.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Conservation Delivery Modernization Act."

SEC. 2. DATA PLATFORM.
The Secretary shall build the Conservation Delivery Platform to collect standardized metrics (soil health, water efficiency, carbon sequestration) from programs such as EQIP, CSP, and the climate-smart agriculture initiative, and share reports with GAO, OMB, and Congress.

SEC. 3. THIRD-PARTY VERIFICATION.
Payments above $250,000 shall require verification by accredited auditors with data submitted through the Platform.
```

**Explanation**: Creates the backbone for the performance-based ladders by aligning data, oversight, and payment integrity.

**Challenges**: Interoperability, producer privacy, and ensuring data definitions align across NRCS programs.

### 2. Equitable Delivery & Access Act

**Purpose**: Provide technical assistance hubs, waiver authority, and additional payments for underserved producers.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Equitable Delivery & Access Act."

SEC. 2. DELIVERY HUBS.
The Secretary shall award cooperative agreements for regional delivery hubs that coordinate funding, outreach, and technical support for BIPOC, beginning, and socially disadvantaged producers.

SEC. 3. WAIVER AUTHORITY.
Allow hubs to waive standard paperwork requirements for underserved producers while still requiring outcome reporting.
```

**Explanation**: Tackles disparity in access by funding hubs and streamlining paperwork.

**Challenges**: Oversight of waivers, auditability, and sustaining trusted community partners.

### 3. Conservation Capital & Risk Pooling Act

**Purpose**: Mobilize private capital through matching grants and risk-pooling agreements for multi-year conservation contracts.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Conservation Capital & Risk Pooling Act."

SEC. 2. MATCH PROGRAM.
Provide a 2:1 federal match for private capital that funds multi-year conservation agreements tied to Platform metrics.

SEC. 3. RISK POOLS.
Authorize USDA Rural Development or another entity to administer risk pools that cover restoration-driven investments in exchange for outcome reporting.
```

**Explanation**: Encourages new sources of capital without overleveraging federal dollars.

**Challenges**: Preventing double-crediting of results, ensuring additionality, and aligning with climate reporting standards.

## Funding and Administration

- Authorize multi-year mandatory funding to avoid annual signup disruptions.
- Require USDA to publish a consolidated conservation delivery plan every two years with staffing targets, equity benchmarks, and outcome metrics.
- Create a technical assistance reserve to expand staffing and certified planners in high-need regions.

## State Model Legislation

States can pass “Conservation Delivery Partnership Acts” that:

- Fund state-managed delivery hubs aligned with federal data requirements.
- Provide matching grants for state climate programs that plug into the federal Platform.
- Authorize state AGs to enforce performance-based clauses for contractors and service providers.

## Regulatory Framework

- USDA must publish guidance on data standards, third-party accreditations, and privacy safeguards.
- OMB should coordinate cross-agency performance metrics to align conservation spending with climate and infrastructure goals.
- GAO will audit the Platform annually, focusing on equity and outcome integrity.
- NRCS should update practice standards to reflect measured outcomes and regional cost variability.

## Legal Considerations

- Constitutional Issues: Ensure data collection respects privacy and avoids unlawful search/ seizure.
- Preemption Questions: Federal mandates should allow stronger state innovation while setting minimum performance requirements.
- Enforcement Mechanisms: Civil penalties, repayment obligations, and suspension of payments for misreported outcomes.
- Sunset & Review: Review the Platform every 5 years with stakeholder input and adjust metrics accordingly.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Double-counting | Producers report similar outcomes to multiple programs without coordination | Medium |
| Auditor capture | Third-party verifiers become dependent on large contractors | Medium |
| Paperwork avoidance | Producers shift to informal agreements to sidestep reporting | Low |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Limited tech capacity | Hubs struggle with data ingestion | Underinvestment in regional digital infrastructure |
| Geographic clustering | Hub capacity concentrates in only a few states | Lack of place-based allocation rules |
| Workforce gaps | Few conservation technicians in underserved regions | Declining extension budgets |

### Rectification Procedures

1. Require cross-program data sharing to prevent double-counting and align incentives.
2. Establish competitive rotation for third-party verifiers to limit capture.
3. Provide targeted IT grants and training for hub personnel in underserved regions.

### General Implementation Concerns

Balancing transparency with producer privacy and ensuring consistent appropriation cycles so hubs and verification systems stay funded.
