# Conservation Program Delivery: Legislation

## Overview

The delivery of federal conservation programs—primarily through the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and Farm Service Agency (FSA)—is the primary mechanism for addressing soil erosion, water quality, and wildlife habitat on private lands. However, the current system is plagued by chronic understaffing, complex application processes, and a mismatch between demand and available funding.

This legislative framework aims to modernize conservation delivery by rebuilding the technical assistance workforce, streamlining program administration, and shifting from a practice-based to an outcomes-based model. It focuses on three key areas: (1) expanding the conservation workforce to clear backlogs; (2) reforming working lands programs (EQIP/CSP) to be more accessible and effective; and (3) updating land retirement programs (CRP) to support working lands transitions and beginning farmers.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for conservation program reform. Congress has ample authority under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) to fund voluntary conservation programs and condition federal benefits on stewardship practices.*

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To modernize Federal working lands conservation programs to improve access, efficiency, and environmental outcomes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Working Lands Program Modernization Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Complex application processes deter many farmers, particularly small and diversified operations, from participating in Federal conservation programs.
(2) Current programs often pay for practices rather than environmental results, limiting innovation.
(3) Upfront costs for conservation practices are a significant barrier for beginning and limited-resource farmers.
(4) Comprehensive conservation systems provide greater benefits than isolated practices.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) WORKING LANDS PROGRAMS.—The term "working lands programs" means the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP).
(2) SMALL-SCALE OPERATION.—The term "small-scale operation" means a farm with gross cash farm income under $350,000.

SEC. 4. STREAMLINED APPLICATION PROCESS.

(a) SINGLE PORTAL.—The Secretary shall develop and implement a single, unified application process for EQIP and CSP.
(b) AUTOMATION.—The process shall utilize automated data retrieval to minimize information required from the applicant.
(c) TIMELINE.—The Secretary shall notify applicants of funding decisions within 60 days of the application deadline.

SEC. 6. OUTCOME-BASED INCENTIVES.

(a) AUTHORITY.—The Secretary may provide bonus payments to producers who demonstrate measured environmental outcomes that exceed standard practice performance.
(b) METRICS.—The Secretary shall establish standardized metrics for soil carbon, water quality, and wildlife habitat to calculate bonus payments.

SEC. 7. COMPREHENSIVE CONSERVATION BUNDLES.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary shall offer "Conservation Bundles" that group complementary practices (e.g., cover crops, no-till, and nutrient management) into a single contract.
(b) INCENTIVE.—Contracts for bundles shall receive a higher payment rate than the sum of individual practice payments to reflect the synergistic benefits.

SEC. 8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) ANNUAL REPORT.—The Secretary shall report annually on:
    (1) Participation rates by farm size and demographic category;
    (2) Processing times for applications;
    (3) The amount of funding provided through advance payments.

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Reduces the "hassle factor" that keeps many farmers away from NRCS offices.
- **Section 5**: Solves the cash-flow problem; currently, farmers must pay for practices upfront and get reimbursed later, which excludes those without credit.
- **Section 7**: Encourages holistic management rather than piecemeal adoption, which science shows is more effective.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Launch Unified Portal | 1 year after enactment | USDA FPAC |
| Issue Advance Payment Guidance | 90 days after enactment | USDA NRCS |
| Define Conservation Bundles | 180 days after enactment | USDA NRCS |

**Challenges**:

- **IT Systems**: USDA's legacy IT systems are notoriously difficult to modernize.
- **Cultural Resistance**: Some field staff prefer the "practice" model over "outcomes" due to ease of verification.

**Refinements**:

- Include specific funding for IT modernization to support the single portal.
- Pilot outcome payments in specific watersheds before national rollout.

### The Conservation Reserve Program Flexibility Act

**Purpose**: To reform the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to allow for more flexible management (grazing, haying) while enhancing wildlife benefits, and to facilitate the transition of CRP land to beginning farmers.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Grazing Flexibility**: Allows managed grazing on CRP land as a standard practice (not just emergency) to improve soil health and support livestock producers.
2. **Transition Incentives**: Enhances the Transition Incentives Program (TIP) to provide 2 extra years of payments to landowners who sell/lease CRP land to beginning farmers.
3. **Climate-Smart CRP**: Creates a new "Climate CRP" sub-program with higher rental rates for practices with high carbon sequestration potential (e.g., bottomland hardwoods, prairie strips).
4. **Early Termination**: Allows early exit from CRP contracts without penalty if the land is transitioned to a regenerative organic system.
5. **Rental Rate Adjustment**: Updates rental rate calculations to better reflect local cash rental markets and prevent competition with beginning farmers for land.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To reform the Conservation Reserve Program to enhance flexibility, support beginning farmers, and maximize climate benefits.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Conservation Reserve Program Flexibility Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) protects environmentally sensitive land but can sometimes lock up land needed for beginning farmers.
(2) Managed grazing can enhance wildlife habitat and soil health on conservation lands.
(3) Transitioning CRP land to sustainable production offers a pathway for new entrants into agriculture.
(4) CRP has significant potential to sequester carbon if managed with climate-smart practices.

SEC. 3. MANAGED GRAZING AUTHORITY.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 1233(b) of the Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to permit managed grazing on CRP land, provided such grazing is consistent with the conservation plan.
(b) PAYMENT REDUCTION.—The Secretary shall not reduce rental payments for managed grazing if it is conducted as part of a soil health or wildlife habitat improvement plan.
(c) RESTRICTIONS.—Grazing shall be timed to avoid nesting seasons for ground-nesting birds.

SEC. 4. TRANSITION INCENTIVES PROGRAM ENHANCEMENT.

(a) EXTENSION.—Section 1235(f) of the Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to provide 4 years of additional payments (increased from 2) to retired farmers who transfer land to beginning, socially disadvantaged, or veteran farmers.
(b) OUTREACH.—The Secretary shall conduct targeted outreach to connect CRP contract holders with potential beginning farmer buyers.

SEC. 5. CLIMATE-SMART CRP.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary shall establish a Climate-Smart CRP initiative.
(b) INCENTIVES.—The Secretary shall offer signing bonuses and higher rental rates for practices with high carbon sequestration potential, including agroforestry, riparian buffers, and permanent native grasses.

SEC. 6. RENTAL RATE REFORM.

(a) MARKET ALIGNMENT.—The Secretary shall update soil rental rates annually based on local cash rent data to ensure rates are competitive but do not artificially inflate land prices.
(b) CAP.—Rental rates shall not exceed 85 percent of the estimated county average cash rent for comparable land.

SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) ANNUAL REPORT.—The Secretary shall report to Congress on:
    (1) The number of acres grazed under managed grazing plans;
    (2) The number of acres transferred to beginning farmers through TIP;
    (3) The estimated carbon sequestration of Climate-Smart CRP acres.

SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $2,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $2,600,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $2,700,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $2,800,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $2,900,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3**: Transforms CRP from a "set-aside" program to a "working lands" program for livestock, recognizing that animals are part of healthy ecosystems.
- **Section 4**: Uses CRP payments as a bridge to help new farmers access land, addressing the barrier of high land costs.
- **Section 6**: Ensures the government doesn't outbid farmers for land, while still paying enough to attract environmentally sensitive acres.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Update Grazing Rules | 90 days after enactment | USDA FSA |
| Launch Climate-Smart CRP | FY 2027 | USDA FSA |
| Update Rental Rates | Annually | USDA FSA |

**Challenges**:

- **Wildlife Groups**: Some groups worry grazing will harm nesting birds; timing restrictions are crucial.
- **Landowners**: Retired farmers may prefer idle land over managing grazing leases.

**Refinements**:

- Require a grazing management plan approved by a wildlife biologist.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Conservation Delivery Support Act

**Purpose**: To leverage federal funds by providing state matching for technical assistance and creating local soil health districts.

**Adaptability Notes**: States with strong Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs) should focus on funding them directly. States without strong districts may need to create a new delivery structure.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Conservation Delivery Support Act".

SECTION 2. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE MATCH.
(a) FUNDING.—The Department of Agriculture shall provide matching grants to Soil and Water Conservation Districts to hire conservation planners and technicians.
(b) PRIORITY.—Priority shall be given to districts that demonstrate a backlog of conservation applications.

SECTION 3. SOIL HEALTH EQUIPMENT GRANT.
(a) PROGRAM.—There is established a grant program to help districts and cooperatives purchase shared conservation equipment (e.g., no-till drills, roller crimpers).
(b) ACCESS.—Equipment shall be made available to farmers at a nominal rental rate.

SECTION 4. STATE CONSERVATION COST-SHARE.
(a) SUPPLEMENT.—The State shall provide a supplemental cost-share payment of 10 percent for projects funded through federal EQIP or CSP contracts within the State.
(b) FOCUS.—The supplement shall prioritize practices that improve water quality and soil health.

SECTION 5. APPROPRIATION.
There is appropriated from the General Fund $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 to carry out this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2**: Ensures that federal dollars don't sit unused because there aren't enough local staff to write the contracts.
- **Section 3**: Lowers the capital barrier for farmers to try new practices like cover cropping without buying expensive machinery.
- **Section 4**: Makes federal programs more attractive by reducing the farmer's out-of-pocket cost.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: USDA NRCS and FSA.

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **TSP Certification Rule**: Revise 7 CFR Part 652 to streamline TSP certification. Deadline: 180 days.
2. **EQIP/CSP Rule Updates**: Revise program rules to implement advance payments and bundled contracts.
3. **CRP Grazing Standards**: Develop national standards for "managed grazing" on CRP lands.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Spot Checks**: Random audits of 5% of contracts annually to ensure practice implementation.
- **Decertification**: TSPs who approve non-compliant plans can lose certification.
- **Contract Termination**: Producers failing to maintain practices must repay funds with interest.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause**: Conditions on conservation payments are constitutional.
**Property Rights**: Access for technical assistance requires landowner permission; privacy of farm data must be protected under Section 1619 of the 2008 Farm Bill.

### Preemption

Federal conservation programs generally do not preempt state regulations. States can impose stricter environmental standards, and federal funds can help farmers meet them.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance relies on the "conservation compliance" framework (Highly Erodible Land and Wetland Conservation). Modernizing this to include soil health metrics requires careful definition to avoid vagueness challenges.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **Contract Splitting** | Large farms split into multiple entities to bypass payment caps. | High | Enforce "actively engaged" rules and attribution to individuals. |
| **"Paper" Grazing** | Landowners claim grazing benefits without actual livestock management. | Medium | Require grazing logs and stocking rate verification. |
| **TSP Conflicts** | Input dealers acting as TSPs to sell products. | Medium | Strict conflict of interest disclosure and prohibition on sales-tied advice. |
| **Practice Abandonment** | Farmers stop practices after contract ends. | High | Long-term maintenance requirements or "enduring practice" bonuses. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Staff Turnover** | Loss of institutional knowledge. | Low pay/burnout. | Retention bonuses and career ladders (Section 4 of Workforce Act). |
| **Tenant Access** | Renters can't sign long-term contracts. | Landlord control. | Allow tenants to sign with shorter terms or landlord waivers. |
| **Inflation** | Fixed payment rates lag costs. | Static rulemaking. | Index payment rates to Producer Price Index. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Attribution Rules**: Strengthen USDA's "person" definition to look through shell companies.
2. **Inflation Adjustment**: Mandate annual review of EQIP payment schedules.
3. **Tenant Provisions**: Create specific contract options for 3-year leases common in agriculture.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **Farm Bill**: Programs expire every 5 years.
- **Hiring Authority**: Direct hire authority sunsets in 2029 to encourage transition to standard hiring.
