## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Privacy-First Performance Platform

- **Bridges**: Conservative, Centrist, Liberal
- **Core agreement**: Outcome tracking without exposing producer-specific data.
- **Policy**: Aggregate reporting thresholds, opt-in verification tiers, and anonymized dashboards.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept phased reporting; conservatives accept standardized metrics.
- **Viability**: High; protects privacy while enabling oversight.

### Compromise 2: Delivery Hubs with State Compacts

- **Bridges**: Constitutionalist, Conservative, Liberal, Populist
- **Core agreement**: Local delivery capacity improves access and speed.
- **Policy**: Federal funding tied to state-led compacts and performance benchmarks.
- **Concessions**: Reformers allow state flexibility; conservatives accept federal funding.
- **Viability**: High; aligns with rural capacity needs.

### Compromise 3: Capital Match with Public Guardrails

- **Bridges**: Centrist, Liberal, Conservative
- **Core agreement**: Private capital can expand scale if public guardrails prevent capture.
- **Policy**: Cap returns, require additionality tests, and include public-interest audits.
- **Concessions**: Market advocates accept oversight; progressives accept limited private role.
- **Viability**: Medium; depends on transparency design.

## Strategic Implications

- Most viable coalition centers on delivery hubs and equity-focused technical assistance.
- Key obstacle is distrust of centralized data collection and third-party verification.
- Bad-faith risk appears limited; focus on incremental wins with clear privacy safeguards.
- Recommended approach: pass Equitable Access and Delivery Hubs first, then phase in the data platform.
