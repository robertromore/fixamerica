## Who Opposes Reform

### Organized Opposition

| Actor | Interest | Resources | Tactics |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Large commodity operations** | Protect payment flows; avoid new compliance burdens | Lobbying budgets; political access; farm coalition membership | Frame reforms as threatening farm viability; oppose payment caps |
| **Some USDA program staff** | Preserve existing workflows; resist disruption | Institutional knowledge; union representation; informal networks | Slow-roll implementation; emphasize complexity; highlight risks |
| **Farm Bureau Federation** | Maintain member benefits; oppose regulations | State and national lobbying; political contributions; grassroots network | Oppose outcome requirements; resist equity mandates; defend status quo |
| **Crop insurance industry** | Protect market share; oppose conservation linkage | Lobbying; relationships with Agriculture Committees | Resist premium discounts for conservation; oppose integration |
| **Some technical service providers** | Preserve fee-for-service model; avoid accountability | Professional associations; NRCS relationships | Resist performance-based contracts; oppose transparency |
| **Input suppliers** | Maintain sales of fertilizers, pesticides | Marketing budgets; dealer networks; political influence | Oppose practices that reduce input use |

### Ideological Opposition

| Perspective | Position | Arguments |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Fiscal conservatives** | Oppose conservation spending expansion | Government shouldn't pay farmers to do what's right; private market should determine land use |
| **Property rights advocates** | Resist conservation requirements | Private landowners should control their land without government dictating practices |
| **Anti-regulation libertarians** | Oppose any compliance mandates | Conservation is desirable but should be voluntary; markets should incentivize |
| **States' rights advocates** | Resist federal standards | States should determine conservation priorities; federal one-size-fits-all inappropriate |

### Political Opposition

| Actor | Position | Motivation |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Some rural Republicans** | Oppose outcome requirements; resist equity focus | View as overreach; skeptical of climate framing |
| **Fiscal hawks** | Target conservation for budget cuts | Large spending vulnerable; question taxpayer value |
| **IRA opponents** | Seek to defund IRA conservation provisions | Political opposition to Biden administration priorities |
| **Some Agriculture Committee members** | Protect commodity programs over conservation | Committee jurisdiction; constituent interests |

### Passive Resistance

| Source | Form | Impact |
|--------|------|--------|
| **Bureaucratic inertia** | Slow implementation; rule complexity | Reform delayed or diluted |
| **Local offices** | Interpret rules narrowly; maintain traditions | Variation in implementation |
| **Established producers** | Don't advocate for changes that might disadvantage them | Status quo maintained |
| **Risk-averse administrators** | Avoid innovation; emphasize compliance | Reform pilots limited |

## Opposition Arguments

### Argument 1: "Outcome Requirements Will Create Unworkable Complexity"

**Claim:** Requiring measurable environmental outcomes rather than practice installation will create impossibly complex verification systems, penalize producers for factors beyond their control (weather, markets), and slow program delivery.

**Supporting Arguments:**

- Environmental outcomes depend on many factors beyond conservation practices
- Measurement science is uncertain, especially for soil carbon
- Verification would require expensive monitoring
- Producers would face payment risk for uncontrollable outcomes

**Reality:**

- Outcome-based approaches work in other contexts (performance contracts, environmental markets)
- Technology enables cost-effective monitoring through remote sensing
- Well-designed programs can account for external factors
- Practice-based payments have their own measurement challenges
- Existing CSP already incorporates outcome elements
- Pilots have demonstrated workable approaches

**Counter-Strategy:**

- Propose phased implementation with practice-outcome hybrid approaches
- Emphasize technology advances in monitoring
- Show successful models from state programs and pilots
- Design risk-sharing that protects producers from uncontrollable factors

---

### Argument 2: "Equity Requirements Will Reduce Program Efficiency"

**Claim:** Prioritizing underserved producers diverts resources from proven conservation performers, slows delivery as programs accommodate inexperienced applicants, and introduces politically motivated criteria into technical programs.

**Supporting Arguments:**

- Conservation programs should prioritize environmental outcomes
- Experienced producers deliver more conservation per dollar
- Equity goals belong in other programs, not conservation
- Application assistance for underserved adds administrative cost

**Reality:**

- USDA equity task force data shows underserved producers can perform well with adequate support
- Current system's "efficiency" excludes large portions of agricultural land
- Diverse agricultural systems improve resilience
- Historical discrimination created current disparities
- Equity and conservation goals can align
- Underserved communities often face greatest environmental burdens

**Counter-Strategy:**

- Show data on underserved producer success when supported
- Frame equity as expanding conservation reach, not limiting it
- Emphasize that current system is not "neutral" but favors those with resources
- Point to Justice40 and broader administration priorities

---

### Argument 3: "Transparency Rules Will Burden Farmers and Violate Privacy"

**Claim:** Enhanced reporting requirements, outcome tracking, and data sharing will impose excessive paperwork on producers, expose private business information, and create data that could be used against farmers.

**Supporting Arguments:**

- Farmers already face excessive paperwork
- Farm financial data is proprietary
- Data could be used for enforcement against producers
- Transparency benefits advocacy groups, not farmers

**Reality:**

- Digital tools can reduce rather than increase reporting burden
- Aggregated outcome data protects individual privacy
- Transparency builds public support for conservation spending
- Current system lacks accountability, enabling fraud and waste
- Other agricultural programs manage data privacy successfully

**Counter-Strategy:**

- Design systems that streamline rather than add reporting
- Implement strong privacy protections with clear limits on data use
- Show how transparency benefits producers by demonstrating program value
- Engage farmers in co-designing data systems

---

### Argument 4: "Payment Caps Will Devastate Large-Scale Conservation"

**Claim:** Meaningful payment limits would exclude the large operations that deliver the most conservation benefit, fragmenting landscapes and reducing program effectiveness.

**Supporting Arguments:**

- Large operations have more acres for conservation
- Economies of scale make large projects more efficient
- Payment caps force artificial entity splitting
- Conservation doesn't scale down efficiently

**Reality:**

- Current system concentrates benefits among largest operations
- Small and medium farms collectively have more acreage than largest farms
- Payment caps exist in other successful farm programs
- Entity splitting can be addressed through attribution rules
- Landscape conservation works through multiple producers, not just large ones

**Counter-Strategy:**

- Propose graduated payment schedules rather than hard caps
- Show that small and medium farms can deliver landscape-scale conservation
- Address entity splitting directly through clear attribution rules
- Emphasize that spreading benefits builds broader political support

---

### Argument 5: "Climate Focus Politicizes Conservation"

**Claim:** Emphasizing climate-smart practices and carbon sequestration transforms traditional conservation into politically charged climate policy, alienating rural communities and producers skeptical of climate science.

**Supporting Arguments:**

- Traditional conservation focused on soil, water, wildlife
- Climate framing divides rather than unites
- Carbon measurement is uncertain and contested
- Climate-smart is just rebranding existing practices

**Reality:**

- Climate-smart practices are mostly the same as traditional conservation (cover crops, no-till, nutrient management)
- Climate framing has unlocked significant new funding (IRA)
- Producers can participate without adopting climate ideology
- Resilience framing bridges climate and traditional conservation
- Avoiding climate framing foregoes funding and relevance

**Counter-Strategy:**

- Emphasize co-benefits: soil health, water quality, profitability
- Use producer-preferred language: resilience, productivity, soil health
- Show that practices are the same regardless of framing
- Focus on voluntary participation and producer choice

---

### Argument 6: "Continuous Sign-Up Would Eliminate Targeting"

**Claim:** Moving from competitive batched sign-ups to continuous enrollment would eliminate the ability to target resources to highest-priority practices and regions, funding first-come rather than best conservation.

**Supporting Arguments:**

- Competitive ranking ensures scarce dollars go to highest-value projects
- Continuous sign-up could exhaust funds on lower-priority practices
- Geographic targeting requires batched allocation
- Competitive ranking has worked for decades

**Reality:**

- Competitive ranking creates barriers that exclude qualifying producers
- Many unfunded applications would deliver substantial conservation
- Continuous can still incorporate targeting through practice priorities
- CRP continuous sign-up has worked well for priority practices
- Batched sign-ups create timing mismatches with farming decisions

**Counter-Strategy:**

- Propose hybrid approaches with continuous for priority practices
- Show that current competitive system excludes substantial conservation
- Design continuous enrollment with built-in targeting mechanisms
- Emphasize that reducing application burden increases participation

---

### Argument 7: "Private Sector Delivery Would Eliminate Accountability"

**Claim:** Expanding use of Technical Service Providers and private-sector delivery would reduce accountability, create conflicts of interest, and diminish the role of experienced NRCS staff.

**Supporting Arguments:**

- Private providers have profit motives that may conflict with conservation
- TSPs may recommend practices that benefit their businesses
- NRCS staff have institutional knowledge and public mission
- Privatization reduces public accountability

**Reality:**

- Current delivery capacity is insufficient; private sector can add capacity
- TSP certification and oversight can ensure quality
- NRCS staff are stretched thin and cannot meet demand
- Other programs successfully use private delivery with public oversight
- Properly designed contracts can align private incentives with public goals

**Counter-Strategy:**

- Propose public-private partnerships rather than privatization
- Maintain NRCS oversight and quality control
- Design performance-based contracts that align incentives
- Position TSPs as supplements to, not replacements for, public staff
