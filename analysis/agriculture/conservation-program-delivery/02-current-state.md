# Conservation Program Delivery: Current State

## Overview

The U.S. conservation program delivery system is experiencing unprecedented funding levels but struggling with implementation capacity. The Inflation Reduction Act added $19.5 billion to conservation programs through 2031, yet NRCS staffing remains below 1990 levels, conservation districts face budget constraints, and application backlogs persist across most states. The gap between available funding and on-the-ground implementation represents both a challenge and an opportunity for reform.
