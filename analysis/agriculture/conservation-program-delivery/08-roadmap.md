# Conservation Program Delivery: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Transforming conservation program delivery requires a phased approach that builds capacity, tests reforms, and codifies successes. This roadmap sequences administrative actions, appropriations requests, and farm bill provisions to create momentum for systemic change. The approach balances urgency with the practical realities of building capacity, changing systems, and maintaining stakeholder support.

## Strategic Approach

### Core Strategy

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Administrative first** | Maximize existing authority before seeking legislative changes |
| **Pilot then scale** | Test reforms before national rollout |
| **Capacity before demand** | Build delivery capacity to absorb increased funding |
| **Equity integration** | Embed equity in every reform, not as an add-on |
| **Stakeholder engagement** | Build support through transparency and participation |
| **Evidence building** | Document outcomes to justify continued investment |

### Political Landscape

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **IRA funding** | Significant resources available; implementation pressure |
| **Farm bill timing** | Opportunity to codify reforms |
| **Bipartisan conservation support** | Political opening for delivery improvements |
| **Climate politics** | Frame reforms in terms that work across perspectives |
| **Budget pressure** | Demonstrate value to maintain funding |

### Implementation Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Reduce burden first** | Early wins through simplification build support |
| **Don't overload staff** | Phase reforms to avoid overwhelming capacity |
| **Preserve optionality** | Design flexible systems that can adapt |
| **Communicate constantly** | Keep stakeholders informed throughout |
| **Measure everything** | Build evidence base for expansion |
