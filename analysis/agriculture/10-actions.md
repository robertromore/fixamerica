### Political Actions

**Federal Advocacy:**

| Issue | Target | Message |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Farm bill reform** | Congress | "Support farm bill reforms that target payments to small and midsize family farms, not large agribusinesses" |
| **Competition enforcement** | USDA, DOJ | "Enforce Packers and Stockyards Act; block further meat industry consolidation" |
| **Conservation funding** | Congress | "Increase funding for EQIP and CSP to reduce waitlists and support farmer-led conservation" |
| **Beginning farmer support** | Congress | "Expand FSA loan programs and land access initiatives for beginning farmers" |
| **Farmworker protections** | Congress | "Include farmworkers in NLRA organizing rights and mandate overtime protections" |
| **Local food support** | Congress | "Expand farm-to-school funding and SNAP farmers market incentives" |

**Sample Advocacy Messages:**

*For farm bill equity:*

> "I'm calling to urge support for farm bill reforms that target commodity program benefits to small and midsize family farms. The current system sends 77% of payments to the largest 10% of operations while small farms struggle. Please support payment caps that can't be circumvented through entity splitting, and means testing that phases out payments for millionaire farmers."

*For competition enforcement:*

> "I'm calling about meat industry concentration. Four companies control 85% of beef processing, giving ranchers few options to sell their cattle at fair prices. Please support USDA enforcement of Packers and Stockyards rules and DOJ action to restore competitive markets. Independent ranchers need fair markets to survive."

*For farmworker protections:*

> "I'm calling about farmworker rights. Agricultural workers were excluded from the National Labor Relations Act in 1935 and still lack basic organizing rights that other workers have. Farmworkers also face heat illness, pesticide exposure, and wage theft without adequate protection. Please support extending NLRA coverage to farmworkers and mandatory OSHA heat illness prevention standards."

*For conservation funding:*

> "I'm calling about conservation program funding. Thousands of farmers want to implement conservation practices but are turned away due to funding limits—EQIP and CSP have multi-year waitlists. Please support increased conservation program funding in the next farm bill to help farmers protect soil, water, and climate."

**State Advocacy:**

| Issue | Target | Message |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **State farmworker protections** | State legislature | Support state overtime, heat safety, organizing rights |
| **Right to farm protections** | State legislature | Protect agricultural operations from nuisance suits |
| **Agricultural districts** | County government | Support farmland preservation zoning |
| **Local food procurement** | State agencies | Support state institutions buying local |
| **Beginning farmer programs** | State agriculture department | Expand state land-linking and training |
