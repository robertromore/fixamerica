# Nutrition & Food Security: History

## Overview

The history of federal nutrition programs in America reflects shifting assumptions about hunger, agriculture, and government responsibility. From Depression-era commodity distribution through modern SNAP, programs have evolved from surplus disposal mechanisms to nutrition-focused safety nets—though tensions between agricultural and nutritional goals persist.

## Lessons from History

### What Has Worked

1. **Entitlement structure**: Responding to need without arbitrary caps
2. **EBT modernization**: Reduced stigma, improved access
3. **Categorical eligibility**: Simplified enrollment
4. **Community eligibility**: Universal school meals
5. **Crisis response**: Program flexibility

### What Has Not Worked

1. **Purchase requirements**: Barrier to access
2. **Time limits without jobs**: Punitive, not effective
3. **Immigrant restrictions**: Created hunger in legal families
4. **Underfunded benefits**: Inadequate for nutrition
5. **Commodity focus**: Calories over nutrition

### Unresolved Tensions

| Tension | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| Agriculture vs. nutrition | Commodity surplus vs. healthy food |
