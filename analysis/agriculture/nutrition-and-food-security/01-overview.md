# Nutrition & Food Security: Overview

## Executive Summary

Nutrition and food security connects agricultural production to healthy diets, food assistance, and equitable access. This subtopic covers federal nutrition programs like SNAP, WIC, and school meals; the retail and transportation barriers that create food deserts; and how agricultural policy can steer production toward nutrient-dense crops and regional supply chains. Despite spending over $120 billion annually on food assistance, the United States still has 44 million people experiencing food insecurity, including 13 million children.

Ensuring food security means stabilizing supply, connecting local producers to markets, and strengthening assistance programs so low-income households can purchase healthy foods. It also requires aligning farm policy with public health goals, reducing the 30-40% of food that is wasted annually, and supporting tribal and community food systems that center sovereignty and traditional foods.

## Current Debate

### Benefit Adequacy and Structure

| Position | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| **Increase benefits** | Current levels insufficient for healthy diet; benefits run out before month end |
| **Maintain current levels** | Benefits adequate for basic needs; budget constraints limit expansion |
| **Add healthy food incentives** | Match benefits for produce purchases to improve diet quality |
| **Expand eligibility** | Too many working families fall through eligibility gaps |
| **Tighten eligibility** | Focus limited resources on those with greatest need |

### Work Requirements

| Position | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| **Strengthen work requirements** | Work promotes self-sufficiency; reduces dependency |
| **Eliminate work requirements** | Administrative burden; don't improve employment outcomes; harm vulnerable |
| **Maintain current balance** | Some requirements appropriate with exemptions for vulnerable populations |
| **Add job training support** | Combine requirements with education and training assistance |

### Local Food Priorities

| Position | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| **Prioritize local procurement** | Supports regional farmers; reduces transportation; builds resilience |
| **Prioritize lowest cost** | Maximize nutrition per dollar; don't increase program costs |
| **Balance approach** | Set local sourcing targets within cost constraints |
| **Let markets decide** | Don't mandate sourcing; let institutions make best choices |

### Program Administration

| Position | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| **Federal administration** | Ensures consistent standards; reduces state variation |
| **State flexibility** | States know local needs; innovation requires flexibility |
| **Simplify enrollment** | Administrative burdens prevent eligible households from participating |
| **Strengthen verification** | Program integrity requires documentation and compliance |
