# Nutrition & Food Security: Solutions

## Overview

Addressing nutrition and food security requires a comprehensive approach that strengthens assistance programs, improves food access, aligns agricultural production with healthy diets, and reduces waste. The solutions presented here build on proven models—nutrition incentives, farm-to-institution procurement, food hub infrastructure, and community food sovereignty—while proposing systemic reforms to federal programs. Success requires coordinating across USDA, HHS, and state agencies while centering equity and public health.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: SNAP Adequacy and Modernization

**Description**: Ensure SNAP benefit levels are adequate for a healthy diet, reduce administrative barriers, and reform work requirements to focus on employment support rather than benefit loss.

**Components**:

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Benefit adequacy** | Index benefits to Low-Cost Food Plan rather than Thrifty Plan; adjust for regional cost variation |
| **Eligibility expansion** | Raise gross income limit to 185% of poverty; eliminate asset tests nationwide |
| **Work requirement reform** | Replace time limits with voluntary employment services; expand exemptions |
| **Administrative simplification** | Extend certification periods to 24 months; allow phone/online recertification |
| **Online access** | Cover delivery fees for SNAP online purchases; expand retailer participation |
| **Immigrants** | Restore eligibility for documented immigrants during waiting period |

**Evidence**:

- Thrifty Food Plan update in 2021 showed benefit increases are feasible
- States with simplified administration have higher participation rates
- Research shows work requirements don't increase employment

**Cost Estimate**: $15-30 billion annually for benefit adequacy improvements

**Challenges**: Fiscal opposition; work requirement politics; state implementation variation

**Evidence**:

- GusNIP and Double Up Food Bucks increase produce purchases 20-40%
- Incentives benefit both participants and farmers
- Strong bipartisan support in Congress

**Implementation Path**:

1. Increase GusNIP funding from $40M to $250M in next farm bill
