# Nutrition & Food Security: Root Causes

## Overview

Food insecurity persists in America despite abundant food production because multiple interlocking systems—benefit inadequacy, food access barriers, production incentives, and political economy—create conditions where tens of millions cannot consistently access nutritious food. Understanding these root causes reveals why program expansion alone has not eliminated hunger.

## Benefit Adequacy Causes

### SNAP Benefit Calculation

**Thrifty Food Plan Limitations**

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Assumes time for cooking | Doesn't reflect working families |
| Assumes bulk purchasing | Requires storage, transportation |
| National average prices | Doesn't reflect local costs |
| Minimal food waste | Unrealistic standard |

**Benefit Shortfall**

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Benefits last ~3 weeks | USDA research |
| 90% of benefits used by day 21 | Transaction data |
| Hunger increase end of month | ER visits, school performance |
| Supplementation required | Food banks report |

### Income Volatility

**Why Benefits Don't Keep Up**

| Factor | Effect on Food Security |
|--------|------------------------|
| Wage stagnation | Purchasing power decline |
| Irregular work hours | Income unpredictability |
| Benefit cliffs | Lose eligibility before self-sufficient |
| Reporting requirements | Administrative burden |

**Poverty Line Inadequacy**

- Federal poverty line set too low for actual costs
- SNAP eligibility tied to inadequate measure
- Working families above poverty but food insecure
- Regional cost differences ignored

## Food Access Causes

### Geographic Access Barriers

**Food Desert Dynamics**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Grocery store closures | Urban and rural |
| Transportation requirements | Car-dependent access |
| Time poverty | Can't travel far for food |
| Price premiums | Small stores charge more |

**USDA Food Access Research Atlas Findings**

| Area Type | Low-Access Population |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Urban low-income | 9.5 million people |
| Rural low-income | 2.2 million people |
| Vehicle access barrier | Additional millions |

### Retail Environment

**SNAP Retailer Issues**

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Minimal stocking requirements | Authorized stores lack produce |
| Dollar store growth | Limited healthy options |
| Convenience store prevalence | High prices, processed foods |
| Supermarket flight | Investment goes to affluent areas |

**Market Concentration**

- Top 4 grocers control 45%+ of market
- Store location decisions favor profitable areas
- Low-income neighborhoods underserved
- Limited competition raises prices

---

## Agricultural Production Causes

### Commodity Program Bias

**Subsidy Distribution**

| Crop Category | Federal Support Level |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Corn, soybeans, wheat | High (insurance, payments) |
| Cotton, rice | High (traditional commodities) |
| Fruits and vegetables | Low (specialty crops) |
| Organic | Growing but limited |

**Effect on Food System**

- Cheap calories from subsidized crops
- Processed food uses commodity inputs
- Fresh produce relatively expensive
- Production concentrated in limited crops

### Supply Chain Structure

**Distribution Challenges**

| Issue | Effect on Access |
|-------|------------------|
| Scale requirements | Small farms excluded |
| Cold chain gaps | Fresh food spoilage |
| Processing concentration | Few regional options |
| Logistics costs | Fresh food expensive to deliver |

**Local Food Barriers**

- Procurement rules favor large distributors
- Liability concerns limit direct sales
- Seasonal production gaps
- Aggregation infrastructure lacking

## Institutional Causes

### Program Administration

**SNAP Administrative Burdens**

| Burden | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Application complexity | Eligible people don't apply |
| Recertification frequency | Churning on/off program |
| Documentation requirements | Working poor can't provide |
| Office hours | Conflict with work schedules |

**Participation Gaps**

| Group | Participation Rate |
|-------|-------------------|
| Eligible elderly | ~45% |
| Eligible working families | ~75% |
| Eligible immigrants | Lower (fear) |
| Overall eligible | ~82% |

### School Meal Program Barriers

**Non-Participation Causes**

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Stigma | Students avoid free meals |
| Paperwork | Families don't apply |
| Debt policies | Unpaid meals denied |
| Quality perceptions | Students bring lunch |

**Why Not Universal**

- Cost concerns (federal budget)
- Means-testing ideology
- Administrative systems built around eligibility
- Political opposition to expansion

### WIC Program Constraints

**Participation Challenges**

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Clinic visits required | Access barrier |
| Limited food package | Doesn't meet all needs |
| Certification complexity | Administrative burden |
| Funding not entitlement | Can be capped |

---

## Political Economy Causes

### Agricultural Interests

**Farm Bill Politics**

| Interest | Position |
|----------|----------|
| Commodity producers | Maintain subsidies |
| Food industry | Oppose purchase restrictions |
| Retailers | Preserve SNAP participation |
| Nutrition advocates | Expand benefits, improve quality |

**Coalition Dynamics**

- Urban-rural coalition historically
- Nutrition title enables commodity title
- Industry lobbying shapes both
- Reform blocked by combined opposition

### Anti-Hunger Opposition

**Arguments Against Expansion**

| Argument | Counter-Evidence |
|----------|-----------------|
| "Work disincentive" | Most recipients work or can't |
| "Fraud and waste" | Error rates historically low |
| "Personal responsibility" | Structural causes predominate |
| "Budget constraints" | Cost of hunger higher |

**Who Benefits from Status Quo**

| Actor | Benefit |
|-------|---------|
| Low-wage employers | Wages subsidized by benefits |
| Food retailers | SNAP spending captured |
| Processed food companies | Commodity system subsidizes inputs |
| Political actors | Wedge issue for campaigns |

## Interconnections and Feedback Loops

### The Poverty-Hunger Trap

```text
Low wages → insufficient income →
food insecurity → health problems →
reduced work capacity → continued poverty →
persistent food insecurity
```

### The Food Desert Reinforcement

```text
Low income neighborhood → grocery disinvestment →
limited healthy options → poor nutrition →
health disparities → reduced economic mobility →
continued neighborhood poverty
```

### The Benefit Inadequacy Cycle

```text
Benefits too low → supplemental food sources needed →
food banks overwhelmed → emergency food insufficient →
hunger persists → political pressure builds →
modest reforms → still inadequate benefits
```

### The Agricultural-Nutrition Disconnect

```text
Commodity subsidies → cheap processed food inputs →
processed food cheaper than fresh →
healthy food relatively expensive →
low-income families buy processed food →
diet-related disease → no pressure to change subsidies
```

## Why Traditional Approaches Fall Short

### Benefit Increases Alone

| Limitation | Why |
|------------|-----|
| Access barriers remain | More money, same food deserts |
| Retail capture | Prices may absorb increases |
| Nutrition not guaranteed | More SNAP, not better diet |
| Political vulnerability | Increases can be reversed |

### Education Alone

| Limitation | Why |
|------------|-----|
| Knowledge not the barrier | People know what's healthy |
| Access determines choices | Can't buy what's unavailable |
| Time poverty | Can't cook elaborate meals |
| Condescending | Blames victims |

### Local Food Alone

| Limitation | Why |
|------------|-----|
| Scale challenges | Can't feed everyone |
| Seasonal gaps | Year-round needs |
| Price premiums | Often more expensive |
| Geographic limits | Not everywhere |

### Charity Alone

| Limitation | Why |
|------------|-----|
| Insufficient scale | Can't meet all need |
| Unpredictable | Depends on donations |
| Often processed | Fresh food harder to handle |
| Stigmatizing | Charitable vs. rights-based |

## Intervention Points

### High-Leverage Opportunities

1. **Benefit adequacy**: Raise SNAP to realistic levels
2. **Universal school meals**: Remove all barriers for children
3. **Grocery investment**: Incentivize stores in underserved areas
4. **Procurement reform**: Connect institutions to local farms
5. **Nutrition incentives**: Double benefits for produce

### Structural vs. Incremental

| Approach | Examples | Potential |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Structural | Universal programs, commodity reform | High but politically difficult |
| Incremental | Benefit increases, pilot programs | Achievable but insufficient |
| Market-based | Incentives, retail investment | Partial, depends on profit |
