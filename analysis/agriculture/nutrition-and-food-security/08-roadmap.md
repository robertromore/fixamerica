# Nutrition & Food Security: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines a phased approach to strengthening nutrition assistance, improving food access, aligning production with healthy diets, and reducing waste. Implementation requires coordinating across USDA, HHS, state agencies, and local partners while navigating farm bill cycles, child nutrition reauthorizations, and appropriations processes. Success depends on building coalitions, leveraging existing momentum (nutrition incentives, universal school meals in states, food hub investments), and demonstrating outcomes that sustain political support.

---

## Strategic Approach

### Core Strategy

| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Legislative vehicles** | Farm bill (nutrition title), Child Nutrition Reauthorization, appropriations |
| **Administrative action** | Executive orders, USDA guidance, CMS waivers |
| **State innovation** | State-level pilots that demonstrate success and build toward federal adoption |
| **Coalition building** | Unite anti-hunger, public health, farmer, and healthcare advocates |
| **Evidence generation** | Rigorous evaluation to document outcomes and counter opposition |
| **Equity centering** | Prioritize underserved communities, tribal nations, BIPOC populations |

### Political Landscape

| Factor | Current Status | Implication |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Farm bill timing** | Next reauthorization due 2028 | Window for nutrition title reforms |
| **Child Nutrition Reauthorization** | Overdue; last in 2010 | Major opportunity for school meal reform |
| **State momentum** | 8+ states with universal school meals | Proof of concept for federal action |
| **Nutrition incentive support** | Bipartisan | GusNIP expansion achievable |
| **SNAP politics** | Contested | Work requirements and benefit levels divisive |
| **Local food interest** | Growing | Farm-to-institution has bipartisan appeal |

### Key Windows of Opportunity

| Window | Timing | Action Required |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **Appropriations cycles** | Annual | Discretionary program funding |
| **Farm bill** | Every 5 years | Major nutrition reforms |
| **Child Nutrition Reauthorization** | Pending | School meal transformation |
| **Economic downturn** | Unpredictable | Increased support for assistance |
| **Administration priorities** | Variable | Executive action opportunities |
| **State elections** | Variable | Universal meals expansion |
