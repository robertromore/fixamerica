# Nutrition & Food Security: Current State

## Overview

The American food system produces enough calories to feed everyone, yet 44 million people experience food insecurity and diet-related diseases remain leading causes of death. This paradox reflects failures in distribution, affordability, and alignment between what agriculture produces and what public health requires. While federal nutrition programs reach tens of millions, gaps persist in access, benefit adequacy, and program design. Food deserts remain widespread in both urban and rural areas, and 30-40% of food produced is wasted before reaching consumers.
