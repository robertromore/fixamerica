## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Incentives With Retailer Flexibility

- **Bridges**: Conservative, Centrist, Liberal
- **Core agreement**: Expand incentives while supporting retailer compliance.
- **Policy**: National match funding paired with POS grants and simplified reporting.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept phased data requirements; conservatives accept federal match funding.
- **Viability**: High; aligns with access and cost concerns.

### Compromise 2: Local Procurement With Seasonal Waivers

- **Bridges**: Progressive, Populist, Constitutionalist
- **Core agreement**: Strengthen local farm demand while respecting state control.
- **Policy**: Procurement targets with seasonal and availability waivers and state-led food hub governance.
- **Concessions**: States accept baseline reporting; reformers accept flexible thresholds.
- **Viability**: Medium-high; depends on state readiness.

### Compromise 3: Food Rescue + Community Partners

- **Bridges**: Religious Right, Conservative, Centrist
- **Core agreement**: Reduce waste while feeding families through trusted networks.
- **Policy**: Expand liability protections and cold storage grants for community partners.
- **Concessions**: Oversight limited to food safety standards.
- **Viability**: High; low controversy and visible benefits.

## Strategic Implications

- Most viable coalition centers on incentives and food rescue investments.
- Key obstacle is concern about procurement mandates and federal overreach.
- Bad-faith risk appears limited; focus on pilot programs with clear outcomes.
- Recommended approach: pass incentives and food rescue first, then phase in procurement and sovereignty programs with opt-in flexibility.
