# Nutrition & Food Security: Stakeholders

## Overview

Nutrition and food security involves a vast network of stakeholders—from the 41 million people who rely on SNAP to the farmers who grow the food, from school nutrition directors to grocery store owners in underserved communities. Understanding who is affected, who has power, and where interests align or conflict is essential for designing reforms that can build coalitions and overcome opposition.
