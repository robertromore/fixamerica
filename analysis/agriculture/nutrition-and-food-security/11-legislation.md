# Nutrition & Food Security: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative framework pairs expanded incentives with procurement reforms, infrastructure spending, tribal partnerships, and waste diversion policy to deliver nutritious food equitably.

## Model Federal Bills

### 1. Healthy Incentives & Digital Access Act

**Purpose**: Scale GusNIP-style incentives, fund online SNAP procurement for produce, and reimburse retailers for upgraded POS systems.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Healthy Incentives & Digital Access Act."

SEC. 2. INCENTIVES.
Provide $1-for-$1 matches for eligible produce purchases and cover delivery fees for online SNAP transactions.

SEC. 3. RETAILER SUPPORT.
Award grants to small retailers for EBT/POS upgrades when they demonstrate produce sourcing plans.
```

### 2. Regional Procurement & Food Hub Investment Act

**Purpose**: Fund food hubs, cold storage, and aggregated procurement for schools, hospitals, and SNAP retailers sourcing locally.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Regional Procurement & Food Hub Investment Act."

SEC. 2. GRANTS.
Provide matching grants for infrastructure and contracts that demonstrate at least 25% procurement of regionally grown produce.

SEC. 3. MATCHING.
Leverage state, philanthropic, and private commitments to expand the reach of food hub networks.
```

### 3. Tribal & Community Food Sovereignty Act

**Purpose**: Fund tribal gardens, indigenous seed systems, community kitchens, and culturally appropriate distribution mechanisms.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Tribal & Community Food Sovereignty Act."

SEC. 2. GRANTS.
Award grants to tribal governments and community food councils for traditional production, restorative agriculture, and distribution systems.

SEC. 3. COORDINATION.
Mandate USDA collaboration with HHS (Indian Health Service) and EPA (water quality).
```

### 4. Food Rescue & Circular Nutrition Infrastructure Act

**Purpose**: Expand gleaning, cold storage for donations, and liability protections for surplus food while connecting rescued produce to incentives.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Food Rescue & Circular Nutrition Infrastructure Act."

SEC. 2. INFRASTRUCTURE.
Fund refrigerated transport, gleaning equipment, and storage that link to SNAP-authorized distribution points.

SEC. 3. LIABILITY PROTECTIONS.
Extend federal protections similar to the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act.
```

## State Model Legislation

States may adopt "Nutrition Equity & Procurement Acts" that:

- Require healthy-procurement plans for state institutions and hospitals.
- Authorize state-level incentives (double bucks) and match federal funds.
- Offer liability shields and logistical support for food rescue partners.

## Regulatory Framework

- USDA FNS must issue guidance on eligible incentive purchases, retailer onboarding, and nutrient standards.
- FDA/HHS should align dietary guidelines with procurement and incentive programs.
- EPA should incorporate food rescue infrastructure into food waste reduction goals and reporting.

## Legal Considerations

- Ensure data privacy when tracking incentive usage and retailer compliance.
- Preemption: Federal baseline should allow states to adopt stronger procurement or incentive rules.
- Enforcement: Quarterly audits of incentive claims, clawbacks for fraud, and civil penalties for misrepresentation.
- Sunset & Review: GAO reports every five years on incentive reach, procurement metrics, and waste diversion.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Retailer gaming | Stores claim incentives without actual produce sales | Medium |
| Procurement double-counting | Institutions count the same produce across multiple commitments | Low |
| Food rescue safety | Expanded rescue networks risk food-safety lapses | Low |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Benefit access | Eligible households do not enroll | Administrative complexity |
| Infrastructure gaps | Many regions lack cold chain capacity | Limited capital/investment |
| Tribal capacity | Underfunded food sovereignty teams | Historic disinvestment |

### Rectification Procedures

1. Require third-party audits and retailer reconciliation statements to ensure incentives match actual produce sales.
2. Dedicate funds to technical assistance for benefit outreach and enrollment (language, technology, transportation).
3. Create targeted infrastructure grants and workforce development for tribal/community programs.

### General Implementation Concerns

Consider phased funding tied to measurable healthy purchase and procurement milestones; align appropriations with multi-year capital investments.
