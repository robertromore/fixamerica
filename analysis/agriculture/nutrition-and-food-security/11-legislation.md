# Nutrition and Food Security: Legislation

## Overview

Legislation in the nutrition and food security domain focuses on modernizing the federal safety net to prioritize "nutrition security"—consistent access to healthy, nutrient-dense foods—rather than just caloric sufficiency. The approach is comprehensive, leveraging the periodic reauthorization of the Farm Bill and Child Nutrition Reauthorization to enact structural changes.

The legislative strategy shifts from a scarcity mindset to an investment model, recognizing that food assistance reduces long-term healthcare costs and improves educational outcomes. Key pillars include updating benefit calculations to reflect modern food costs, integrating food-as-medicine interventions into healthcare, and establishing universal school meals to eliminate stigma and administrative burden. While federal law provides the primary funding and framework (SNAP, WIC, School Meals), state model legislation is essential for closing coverage gaps and improving delivery systems.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for nutrition and food security reform. Congress has ample authority under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) to fund general welfare programs like SNAP and school meals, and under the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) to regulate the food systems and supply chains that distribute these goods.*

## Federal Legislation

### The Nutrition Security and Access Modernization Act

**Purpose**: To modernize the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by updating benefit adequacy metrics, expanding access for students and older adults, and incentivizing the purchase of nutrient-dense foods.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Thrifty Food Plan Modernization**: Mandates a 5-year review cycle for the Thrifty Food Plan based on dietary guidelines and actual consumption patterns, not just cost neutrality.
2. **Hot Foods and Prepared Meals**: Permits the purchase of hot foods for elderly, disabled, and homeless populations nationwide.
3. **Student Eligibility Reform**: Permanently aligns SNAP eligibility for college students with financial aid need rather than work requirements.
4. **Nutrition Incentives**: Expands the Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program (GusNIP) to provide a 50% bonus on fruit and vegetable purchases.
5. **EBT Security**: Mandates chip-and-pin technology for EBT cards to prevent skimming and theft.

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To provide universal free school meals to students, support local agriculture, and improve child nutrition.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Healthy School Meals for All Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) 1 in 8 children in the United States faces food insecurity (USDA, 2023).
(2) Universal school meals reduce stigma, eliminate "lunch shaming," and improve academic performance.
(3) Administrative costs associated with processing applications and collecting fees divert resources from food quality.
(4) Schools purchasing local foods support regional agricultural economies and provide fresher, more nutritious meals.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) SCHOOL FOOD AUTHORITY.—The term "school food authority" has the meaning given the term in section 12(d) of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act.
(2) LOCAL FOOD.—The term "local food" means food produced within the State or within 250 miles of the school food authority.

SEC. 4. UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEAL SERVICE.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any school food authority participating in the school lunch program or school breakfast program shall serve meals to all students at no cost to the student.
(b) ELIMINATION OF APPLICATIONS.—School food authorities shall not be required to collect applications for free or reduced-price meals for the purpose of meal reimbursement.
(c) DIRECT CERTIFICATION.—States shall continue to conduct direct certification to identify students eligible for other Federal assistance programs.

SEC. 5. REIMBURSEMENT RATES.

(a) INCREASE.—The national average payment rate for each lunch and breakfast served shall be increased by $0.45, adjusted annually for inflation.

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Eliminates the three-tiered payment system (free/reduced/paid), simplifying administration and removing stigma.
- **Section 5**: Sets reimbursement at the highest rate ("free" rate) plus a boost, acknowledging that current rates often force schools to rely on processed foods.
- **Section 6**: Creates a market for local farmers, connecting agricultural policy with nutrition policy.
- **Section 8**: Wipes the slate clean for families and districts burdened by unpaid lunch fees.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Issue reimbursement guidance | Jan 1, 2027 | USDA FNS |

3. **Medically Tailored Meals (MTM)**: Establishes a Medicare pilot program for medically tailored meals for beneficiaries with diet-related chronic conditions.
4. **Produce Prescriptions**: Authorizes grants for healthcare providers to prescribe fresh fruits and vegetables to low-income patients.

**Draft Text**:

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To modernize the WIC program and integrate nutrition interventions into the healthcare system.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "WIC Modernization and Food as Medicine Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Only 51 percent of eligible individuals currently participate in WIC, partly due to administrative barriers (USDA, 2023).
(2) The "kindergarten gap" leaves children between age 5 and school entry without nutritional support.
(3) Medically tailored meals have been shown to reduce hospital readmissions by 50 percent and net healthcare costs by 16 percent (Tufts University, 2022).
(4) Remote WIC services during the COVID-19 pandemic increased participation and appointment attendance.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) MEDICALLY TAILORED MEAL.—The term "medically tailored meal" means a meal approved by a registered dietitian nutritionist that addresses the specific medical needs of an individual.
(2) WIC.—The term "WIC" means the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children.

SEC. 4. WIC MODERNIZATION.

(a) ELIGIBILITY EXTENSION.—Section 17(d)(3)(A) of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 is amended—
    (1) by striking "1 year" and inserting "2 years" regarding postpartum women; and
    (2) by striking "fifth birthday" and inserting "sixth birthday" regarding children.
(b) REMOTE SERVICES.—State agencies are authorized to conduct certification appointments via video or telephone and to allow online purchasing of WIC foods.

SEC. 5. MEDICARE MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS PILOT.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish a 5-year pilot program to cover medically tailored meals for Medicare beneficiaries with congestive heart failure, diabetes, or kidney disease.
(b) COVERAGE.—The pilot shall cover up to 2 meals per day for a duration determined by the prescribing physician.

SEC. 6. PRODUCE PRESCRIPTION GRANTS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Agriculture shall award grants to eligible entities to conduct produce prescription programs.
(b) ELIGIBLE ENTITIES.—Eligible entities include Federally qualified health centers, hospitals, and non-profit organizations.

SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) WIC REPORT.—The Secretary of Agriculture shall report annually on the impact of eligibility extensions on child health outcomes.
(b) PILOT EVALUATION.—The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall submit a report to Congress evaluating the cost-savings of the MTM pilot not later than 3 years after implementation.

SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $800,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $1,200,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $1,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $1,800,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Closes the gap where children lose WIC before starting school meals and makes pandemic-era flexibilities permanent to boost participation.
- **Section 5**: Tests the "Food as Medicine" concept at scale within Medicare to demonstrate cost savings.
- **Section 6**: Provides direct funding for doctors to treat food insecurity as a health condition.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Issue WIC remote service guidance | 90 days after enactment | USDA FNS |
| Launch MTM Pilot applications | 180 days after enactment | HHS / CMS |
| First Produce Prescription grants | FY 2027 | USDA NIFA |

**Challenges**:

- **Healthcare Integration**: Bridging the data systems of healthcare (HIPAA-compliant) and food retailers is technically complex.
- **Cost**: Extending WIC eligibility significantly increases the program's baseline cost.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Nutrition Supplement and Local Food Act

**Purpose**: To fill gaps in federal nutrition assistance by supplementing SNAP benefits for seniors and funding universal school meals if federal action stalls.

**Adaptability Notes**: States with robust agricultural sectors should emphasize the farm-to-school components. States with high costs of living should focus on the SNAP supplement minimums.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Nutrition Supplement and Local Food Act".

SECTION 2. STATE SNAP SUPPLEMENT.
(a) MINIMUM BENEFIT.—The Department of Human Services shall provide a State-funded supplement to any household receiving Federal SNAP benefits such that the total monthly benefit is not less than $95.
(b) SENIOR SUPPLEMENT.—Households with a member age 60 or older shall receive an additional State supplement of $50 per month to support dietary needs.

SECTION 3. HEALTHY SCHOOL MEALS FOR ALL.
(a) STATE REIMBURSEMENT.—If Federal law does not provide universal free meals, the Department of Education shall reimburse school districts for the difference between the Federal reimbursement and the cost of providing free meals to all students.
(b) LOCAL PURCHASING.—The Department shall provide a grant of $0.15 per meal to districts where at least 25% of food is sourced from [State] farms.

SECTION 4. FOOD DESERT ELIMINATION FUND.
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established the Food Desert Elimination Fund to provide grants and low-interest loans to grocery stores and cooperatives opening in designated food deserts.
(b) ELIGIBILITY.—Eligible entities must accept SNAP and WIC benefits and dedicate at least 30% of shelf space to fresh produce, meats, and dairy.

SECTION 5. APPROPRIATION.
There is appropriated from the General Fund $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 to carry out this Act.
```

**Explanation**: The model act operates on three complementary tracks. First, the **State SNAP Supplement** (Section 2) addresses the persistent gap between federal benefit levels and actual food costs by establishing a state-funded floor of $95 per month and a senior add-on, recognizing that older adults face higher nutritional needs and lower incomes. Second, **Healthy School Meals for All** (Section 3) creates a state backstop for universal free meals if Congress fails to act, while the local purchasing grant incentivizes farm-to-school procurement, strengthening both child nutrition and local agricultural economies. Third, the **Food Desert Elimination Fund** (Section 4) tackles geographic access by financing new grocery infrastructure in underserved areas, with the 30% fresh-food shelf requirement ensuring that subsidized stores actually improve diet quality rather than simply adding another convenience store. States with strong agricultural sectors should increase the local purchasing grant rate; high-cost-of-living states should raise the SNAP supplement floor above $95. The $50 million appropriation is a starting baseline; states should scale based on unmet need, typically estimated at $8-12 per capita in food-insecure populations.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **WIC Food Package Updates**: Revise WIC packages to permanently increase fruit and vegetable vouchers (Cash Value Benefit) and allow more cultural food options. Deadline: 1 year.
2. **Smart Snacks in School**: Update competitive food standards to align with the latest Dietary Guidelines, specifically reducing added sugars.
3. **Online SNAP Retailer Standards**: Simplify requirements for small farmers and independent grocers to accept SNAP online.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: Fines of up to $100,000 for retailers engaging in SNAP trafficking or fraud.
- **Administrative Actions**: Disqualification of retailers from the SNAP program; withholding of administrative funds from States with high error rates.
- **Private Right of Action**: Not generally applicable for benefit levels, but applicable for discrimination claims under USDA civil rights regulations.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

Federal nutrition programs are firmly grounded in the **Spending Clause**. Conditions placed on states (e.g., EBT security standards) are permissible as they are unambiguous and related to the federal interest in program integrity (*South Dakota v. Dole*).

### Preemption

Federal law generally sets the floor for nutrition benefits. States cannot lower SNAP benefits below federal levels but can supplement them (as seen in the Model Act). States cannot impose additional eligibility criteria (like drug testing or stricter work requirements) that conflict with federal statute.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is monitored through the **Quality Control (QC)** system. States must report error rates; high error rates trigger fiscal sanctions. Retailer compliance is monitored via data analytics to detect trafficking patterns (e.g., rapid successive large transactions).

---

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **Small Retailer Exemption** | "Candy stores" classifying as grocers to accept SNAP without offering healthy food. | Medium | Strengthen "depth of stock" requirements for SNAP authorization. |
| **Geographic Work Waivers** | States gerrymandering unemployment data to waive work requirements for wealthy areas. | Medium | Standardize data sources and geographic units for waiver applications. |
| **Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE) Restrictions** | States setting asset limits too low, discouraging savings. | High | Mandate federal minimum asset limits or eliminate asset tests via BBCE. |
| **Third-Party Processors** | Online SNAP processors charging high fees to small farmers, blocking entry. | Medium | Cap transaction fees for SNAP online processing. |
| **College Meal Plans** | Universities requiring expensive meal plans that SNAP doesn't cover. | Low | Allow SNAP to be used for university meal plans if they meet nutrition standards. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Cliff Effect** | Small income increase leads to total loss of benefits. | Strict income thresholds. | Implement a gradual benefit taper (2:1 deduction rate). |
| **Rural Access** | Online delivery unavailable in rural food deserts. | Logistics costs. | Subsidize delivery fees for SNAP online orders in rural areas. |
| **Stigma** | Eligible families do not apply. | Cultural perception / administrative burden. | Universal school meals; rename programs (e.g., "Food Support"). |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Benefit Taper**: Amend the Food and Nutrition Act to reduce benefits by $0.20 for every additional dollar earned above the threshold, rather than immediate cutoff.
2. **Delivery Subsidies**: Authorize USDA to pay delivery fees for online SNAP purchases in designated rural zones.
3. **Stocking Standards**: Revise "staple food" definitions to require more perishable items for retailer authorization.
4. **Data Sharing**: Mandate data sharing between Medicaid and SNAP to automate enrollment (cross-enrollment).

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **Farm Bill Programs**: Generally expire every 5 years; require reauthorization.
- **Thrifty Food Plan**: Review mandated every 5 years under the proposed legislation.
- **GusNIP**: Requires evaluation report to Congress every 2 years on fruit/vegetable consumption impact.
