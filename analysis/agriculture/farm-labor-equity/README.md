# Farm Labor & Equity: Overview

Farm labor and equity focuses on the human infrastructure that keeps food on the shelves—from the hands that harvest specialty crops to the drivers who move commodities. This subtopic examines wages, worker safety, housing, immigration, and pathways for marginalized and BIPOC farmworkers, recognizing that labor shortages and exploitative practices weaken rural economies and supply chains. American agriculture depends on approximately 2.4 million hired farmworkers, the majority of whom are immigrants, yet labor protections remain weaker than in virtually any other sector.
