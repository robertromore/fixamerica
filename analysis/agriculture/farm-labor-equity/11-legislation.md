# Farm Labor and Equity: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative framework for farm labor equity seeks to correct historical exclusions that have left agricultural workers without the basic protections afforded to nearly all other U.S. workers. Since the 1930s, farmworkers have been explicitly excluded from the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and partially excluded from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), creating a two-tiered labor system.

This legislative package pursues a comprehensive modernization of agricultural labor policy. It extends fundamental rights—overtime pay, collective bargaining, and safety standards—while addressing the reality that nearly half the workforce lacks authorized immigration status. The approach balances the moral imperative of worker dignity with the economic necessity of a stable, legal workforce for American farmers. It moves beyond the piecemeal H-2A guest worker program toward a system that offers portability, stability, and legal recourse.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for farm labor reform. Congress has broad authority under the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) to regulate labor standards in industries affecting interstate commerce, and under its Naturalization power (Article I, Section 8, Clause 4) to reform immigration status for farmworkers.*

## Federal Legislation

### The Agricultural Labor Relations and Standards Act

**Purpose**: To end the historical exclusion of farmworkers from federal labor protections by extending collective bargaining rights, overtime pay, and minimum wage guarantees to the agricultural sector.

**Key Provisions**:

1.  **NLRA Inclusion**: Amends the National Labor Relations Act to remove the exemption for "agricultural laborers," granting them the right to organize and bargain collectively.
2.  **Overtime Pay**: Phases in overtime pay requirements for agricultural workers over a 4-year period, eventually matching the standard 40-hour workweek.
3.  **Minimum Wage**: Eliminates remaining exemptions for small farms and piece-rate work that allow sub-minimum wage payments.
4.  **Child Labor Protections**: Raises the minimum age for hazardous agricultural work to 18, aligning it with other industries.
5.  **Private Right of Action**: Establishes a clear federal right for workers to sue employers for wage theft and retaliation.

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To provide fairness for farm workers by extending labor protections and organizing rights.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Agricultural Labor Relations and Standards Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Agricultural workers were excluded from the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 due to racially motivated compromises of that era.
(2) Farm work is one of the most hazardous occupations in the United States, yet workers lack the power to negotiate for safer conditions.
(3) The average farmworker family earns less than $30,000 annually, with 20 percent living below the poverty line (DOL NAWS, 2022).
(4) Extending basic labor rights to farmworkers is essential for the dignity of labor and the stability of the nation's food supply.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYEE.—The term "agricultural employee" means any individual employed by an employer in agriculture, as defined in section 3(f) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.
(2) EMPLOYER.—The term "employer" includes any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee.

SEC. 4. AMENDMENTS TO THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT.

(a) DEFINITION OF EMPLOYEE.—Section 2(3) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 152(3)) is amended by striking "as an agricultural laborer, or".
(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendment made by subsection (a) shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act.

SEC. 5. OVERTIME PROTECTIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS.

(a) AMENDMENT.—Section 13(b)(12) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 213(b)(12)) is repealed.
(b) PHASE-IN.—Notwithstanding the repeal in subsection (a), overtime compensation for agricultural employees shall be phased in as follows:
    (1) YEAR 1.—No overtime required.
    (2) YEAR 2.—Overtime required for hours worked in excess of 55 in a workweek.
    (3) YEAR 3.—Overtime required for hours worked in excess of 50 in a workweek.
    (4) YEAR 4.—Overtime required for hours worked in excess of 45 in a workweek.
    (5) YEAR 5 AND THEREAFTER.—Overtime required for hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek.

SEC. 6. CHILD LABOR PROTECTIONS.

(a) HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS.—Section 13(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended to prohibit the employment of any individual under the age of 18 in an agricultural occupation declared hazardous by the Secretary of Labor.
(b) GENERAL AGE LIMIT.—No individual under the age of 14 may be employed in agriculture outside of school hours, except on a farm owned or operated by their parent or legal guardian.

SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) ANNUAL REPORT.—The Secretary of Labor shall submit an annual report to Congress detailing:
    (1) The number of agricultural workers covered by collective bargaining agreements.
    (2) The economic impact of overtime requirements on farm profitability.
    (3) Enforcement actions taken regarding child labor violations in agriculture.

SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to the Department of Labor to carry out this Act—
    (1) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $60,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $70,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $80,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $90,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

Except as provided in section 4, this Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

-   **Section 4**: Corrects the 1935 exclusion, allowing farmworkers to form unions without fear of retaliation, mirroring rights held by other private sector workers.
-   **Section 5**: Recognizes the seasonal nature of farming by phasing in overtime over 5 years, giving farmers time to adjust labor practices and pricing.
-   **Section 6**: Closes the loophole that allows children as young as 12 to work unlimited hours in agriculture, often in dangerous conditions.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Issue guidance on union elections | 180 days after enactment | NLRB |
| Begin overtime phase-in (55 hours) | Jan 1, 2028 | DOL WHD |
| Full 40-hour overtime implementation | Jan 1, 2031 | DOL WHD |

**Challenges**:

-   **Cost Absorption**: Farmers may struggle to pass increased labor costs to retailers/consumers, potentially accelerating consolidation.
-   **Enforcement**: Monitoring hours on remote, informal worksites is historically difficult.

**Refinements**:

-   Include a tax credit for small farms to offset a portion of overtime costs during the transition period.

### The Farmworker Health, Safety, and Housing Act

**Purpose**: To establish mandatory federal standards for heat stress prevention, pesticide exposure, and employer-provided housing quality.

**Key Provisions**:

1.  **Heat Stress Standard**: Mandates OSHA to issue a specific standard for heat illness prevention, including water, shade, and rest breaks.
2.  **Pesticide Protection**: Transfers worker protection standards from EPA to OSHA and strengthens enforcement and training requirements.
3.  **Housing Standards**: Updates standards for H-2A and migrant housing, requiring inspections prior to occupancy.
4.  **Disaster Pay**: Creates a disaster insurance fund to compensate workers for lost wages due to extreme weather events (wildfires, floods).
5.  **Transportation Safety**: Mandates seatbelts and vehicle safety inspections for farm labor transport vehicles.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To ensure the health, safety, and dignified housing of agricultural workers.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Farmworker Health, Safety, and Housing Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Agricultural workers die from heat-related illness at a rate 20 times higher than the rest of the U.S. workforce (CDC).
(2) Pesticide exposure causes acute and chronic health issues for thousands of farmworkers annually.
(3) Migrant housing often lacks basic sanitation, contributing to disease outbreaks.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) HEAT ILLNESS.—The term "heat illness" means a serious medical condition resulting from the body's inability to cope with a particular heat load.
(2) MIGRANT HOUSING.—The term "migrant housing" means housing provided by an agricultural employer for temporary or seasonal workers.

SEC. 4. HEAT ILLNESS PREVENTION STANDARD.

(a) RULEMAKING.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall promulgate a final standard on heat illness prevention.
(b) REQUIREMENTS.—The standard shall require:
    (1) Access to potable water at no cost.
    (2) Access to shade or climate-controlled environments.
    (3) Paid rest breaks of at least 10 minutes every 2 hours when temperatures exceed 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
    (4) Training for employees and supervisors on recognizing heat illness.

SEC. 5. PESTICIDE SAFETY MODERNIZATION.

(a) TRANSFER OF AUTHORITY.—Authority for the Worker Protection Standard (40 C.F.R. Part 170) is transferred from the Environmental Protection Agency to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
(b) ENFORCEMENT.—OSHA shall conduct random, unannounced inspections of agricultural worksites to ensure compliance with pesticide safety rules.

SEC. 6. HOUSING STANDARDS AND INSPECTION.

(a) STANDARDS.—The Secretary of Labor shall update standards for agricultural housing to ensure structural safety, adequate square footage per occupant, and sanitation.
(b) PRE-OCCUPANCY INSPECTION.—No employer may house workers until the facility has passed a Federal or State inspection within the preceding 12 months.

SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) ANNUAL REPORT.—The Secretary of Labor shall report annually to Congress on:
    (1) The number of heat-related injuries and deaths in agriculture.
    (2) The number of housing inspections conducted and violations found.

SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $110,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $120,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $130,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $140,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

-   **Section 4**: Creates a national floor for heat safety, modeling successful state laws in California and Washington, to prevent preventable deaths.
-   **Section 5**: Moves pesticide safety to OSHA, the agency with labor enforcement expertise, rather than EPA which focuses on product registration.
-   **Section 6**: Ensures that guest workers and migrants are not forced to live in squalid conditions as a condition of employment.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Publish Heat Standard NPRM | 180 days after enactment | OSHA |
| Transfer Pesticide Authority | Oct 1, 2027 | EPA / OSHA |
| Housing Inspection Protocol | Jan 1, 2027 | DOL WHD |

**Challenges**:

-   **Housing Stock**: Strict standards may lead some farmers to stop providing housing, worsening the housing shortage for workers.
-   **Inspection Capacity**: OSHA currently lacks the staff to inspect millions of acres of farmland.

### The Agricultural Visa Modernization and Stabilization Act

**Purpose**: To reform the H-2A guest worker program to allow visa portability (ending the "tied" labor system) and create a pathway to legal status for the existing undocumented workforce.

**Key Provisions**:

1.  **Certified Agricultural Worker (CAW) Status**: Creates a renewable legal status for undocumented workers with significant agricultural work history.
2.  **H-2A Portability**: Allows H-2A workers to change employers within the agricultural sector, increasing bargaining power.
3.  **Year-Round Visas**: Expands H-2A to year-round industries (like dairy) with a cap.
4.  **E-Verify Mandate**: Phases in mandatory E-Verify for agricultural employers once the legalization program is fully implemented.
5.  **Wage Stabilization**: Freezes the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR) for one year and limits annual increases thereafter to stabilize costs.

**Draft Text**:

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To reform the H-2A program and provide stability for the agricultural workforce.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Agricultural Visa Modernization and Stabilization Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) At least 50 percent of the U.S. agricultural workforce lacks authorized immigration status.
(2) The current H-2A program is administratively burdensome for farmers and leaves workers vulnerable to exploitation due to lack of portability.
(3) A stable, legal workforce is a matter of national security.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) CERTIFIED AGRICULTURAL WORKER.—The term "Certified Agricultural Worker" means an alien who has performed at least 1,035 hours of agricultural labor during the 2-year period preceding the date of enactment.
(2) PORTABILITY.—The ability of a nonimmigrant worker to change employers without leaving the United States.

SEC. 4. CERTIFIED AGRICULTURAL WORKER STATUS.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of Homeland Security shall establish a program to grant Certified Agricultural Worker status to eligible aliens.
(b) ELIGIBILITY.—An alien is eligible if they:
    (1) Performed agricultural labor for at least 1,035 hours in the preceding 2 years.
    (2) Pass a criminal background check.
(c) PATH TO PERMANENT RESIDENCE.—A Certified Agricultural Worker may adjust to lawful permanent resident status after performing agricultural labor for an additional 4 years (if they have worked in ag for 10+ years prior) or 8 years (if less than 10 years prior).

SEC. 5. H-2A PROGRAM REFORM.

(a) PORTABILITY.—An alien admitted under section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act may accept new employment with another registered H-2A employer after 30 days of initial employment.
(b) YEAR-ROUND NEEDS.—The Secretary shall make available up to 20,000 visas annually for year-round agricultural sectors, including dairy.

SEC. 6. WAGE STABILIZATION.

(a) FREEZE.—The Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR) in effect on the date of enactment shall remain in effect for 1 year.
(b) CAP.—Thereafter, the AEWR may not increase by more than 3.25 percent or decrease by more than 1.5 percent annually.

SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) VISA USAGE.—The Secretary of State shall report annually on H-2A visa issuances and portability transfers.
(b) WORKFORCE STABILITY.—The Secretary of Agriculture shall report on labor shortages and the impact of the CAW program.

SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to DHS and USDA—
    (1) $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

-   **Section 4**: Solves the "undocumented" crisis by bringing workers out of the shadows, stabilizing the workforce for farmers while granting rights to workers.
-   **Section 5**: Introduces market forces to the guest worker program; if an employer is abusive, the worker can leave for a better farm, reducing exploitation.
-   **Section 6**: Provides cost certainty for farmers in exchange for the legalization program.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| CAW Application Portal Opens | July 1, 2027 | DHS USCIS |
| Portability System Live | Jan 1, 2027 | DOL / DHS |
| E-Verify Mandate Phase-In | Jan 1, 2030 | DHS |

**Challenges**:

-   **Political Polarization**: Immigration is a "third rail"; linking legalization to E-Verify is the only path but risks losing support from both wings.
-   **Administrative Load**: Processing millions of CAW applications will strain USCIS.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Farmworker Rights Act

**Purpose**: To fill gaps in federal protection by establishing state-level overtime, heat standards, and labor relations boards where federal action lags.

**Adaptability Notes**: States with short growing seasons may need different overtime thresholds than year-round states like California or Florida.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Farmworker Rights Act".

SECTION 2. AGRICULTURAL OVERTIME.
(a) REQUIREMENT.—No agricultural employer shall employ any agricultural employee for a workweek longer than 40 hours unless such employee receives compensation for employment in excess of the hours above at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which they are employed.
(b) PHASE-IN.—The requirement in subsection (a) shall phase in over 4 years, starting at 55 hours.

SECTION 3. HEAT ILLNESS PREVENTION.
(a) TRIGGER.—Heat illness prevention procedures must be initiated when the outdoor temperature exceeds 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
(b) WATER AND SHADE.—Employers must provide one quart of water per employee per hour and access to shade that allows the body to cool.

SECTION 4. AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD.
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established the Agricultural Labor Relations Board to oversee union elections and unfair labor practice charges in the agricultural sector.
(b) ACCESS.—Union organizers shall have access to employer property for 1 hour before and after work and during lunch breaks for the purpose of communicating with employees.

SECTION 5. APPROPRIATION.
There is appropriated from the General Fund $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 to carry out this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

-   **Section 2**: Ensures farmworkers are paid fairly for long hours, matching the dignity accorded to other workers.
-   **Section 3**: Saves lives by mandating water and shade, a critical need in warming climates.
-   **Section 4**: Creates a mechanism for resolving labor disputes peacefully and legally.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Department of Labor (Wage and Hour Division, OSHA).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1.  **Heat Stress Standard**: OSHA must define "high heat" and specific compliance measures. Deadline: 1 year.
2.  **H-2A Portability Rules**: DHS/DOL must create a system for transferring visas between employers quickly (within 14 days).
3.  **Overtime Calculation**: DOL must issue guidance on calculating regular rates for piece-rate workers to ensure overtime compliance.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

-   **Civil Penalties**: Up to $50,000 for willful violations of safety or wage laws; up to $250,000 if a death occurs.
-   **Administrative Actions**: Debarment from the H-2A program for 3 years for repeat offenders.
-   **Private Right of Action**: Workers may sue for back wages and liquidated damages.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause**: Federal regulation of farm labor is well-established under *Wickard v. Filburn*.
**Takings Clause**: Union access to farm property (Section 4 of State Model) must comply with *Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid* (2021), which ruled that California's access regulation was a per se taking. The model act may need to provide compensation or limit access to non-work areas.

### Preemption

The proposed federal legislation sets a floor, not a ceiling. States may enact stricter overtime or safety standards (savings clause included). However, H-2A visa rules are federally preemptive regarding immigration status.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance relies on "hot goods" provisions—goods produced in violation of labor laws can be stopped from shipping interstate. This puts pressure on retailers to ensure their supply chains are compliant.

---

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **Farm Labor Contractor (FLC) Shield** | Growers use FLCs to avoid liability for violations. | High | "Joint Employer" liability provision in Section 3 definitions. |
| **Small Farm Exemption** | Farms under 500 man-days exempt from FLSA. | Medium | Lower exemption threshold to 50 man-days. |
| **Piece-Rate Obfuscation** | Employers set piece rates so low that overtime is negligible. | Medium | Mandate base hourly guarantee + overtime on piece earnings. |
| **"Volunteer" Classification** | Classifying workers as interns/volunteers. | Low | Strict "employee" definition test. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Housing Shortage** | H-2A expansion increases demand for rural housing. | NIMBYism / Cost. | USDA Rural Development housing grants. |
| **Retaliation Fear** | Workers won't report violations despite rights. | Immigration status. | "Deferred Action" for labor enforcement witnesses. |
| **Data Gaps** | Hard to track mobile workforce. | Informal economy. | National Farmworker Database. |

### Rectification Procedures

1.  **Joint Liability**: Amend the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA) to automatically make growers joint employers with FLCs.
2.  **Retaliation Shield**: Grant automatic temporary work authorization to any worker with a credible labor complaint under investigation.
3.  **Housing Bank**: Create a federal revolving loan fund for on-farm housing construction.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

-   **AEWR Freeze**: Sunsets after 1 year.
-   **Review**: GAO study on the economic impact of overtime required 3 years after full implementation.
