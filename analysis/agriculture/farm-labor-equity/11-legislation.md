# Farm Labor & Equity: Legislation

## Overview

Legislation should set living wage floors, fund housing/health upgrades, reform visa policy, and seed worker ownership. The bills below combine enforcement, funding, and visa modernization.

## Model Federal Bills

### 1. Farm Workforce Equity & Infrastructure Act

**Purpose**: Fund housing repairs, transportation upgrades, clinics, and wage compliance monitoring.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Farm Workforce Equity & Infrastructure Act."

SEC. 2. EQUITY FUND.
The Secretary shall award grants covering up to 90% of housing/transportation/health upgrades for farms that pay a fair farmworker wage (120% of prevailing local wage).

SEC. 3. COMPLIANCE.
Require employers receiving funds to submit quarterly reports on wages, hours, housing conditions, and grievance outcomes.
```

**Explanation**: Ties capital investments to living wage compliance and worker safety.

**Challenges**: Monitoring thousands of employers and verifying reporting accuracy.

### 2. Portable Agricultural Workforce Act

**Purpose**: Allow H-2A workers to port certifications, streamline recruitment, and tie visas to domestic hiring pathways with worker protection.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Portable Agricultural Workforce Act."

SEC. 2. VISA PORTABILITY.
H-2A visas remain valid when workers change certified employers within 90 days; DHS shall maintain a national registry that flags outstanding wage complaints.

SEC. 3. DOMESTIC PATHWAY.
DOL shall create a domestic worker preference program that certifies ready workers with training subsidies.
```

**Explanation**: Reduces forced loyalty, speeds recruitment, and creates domestic options.

**Challenges**: DHS/DOL coordination and employer acceptance.

### 3. Worker Ownership & Cooperative Accelerator Act

**Purpose**: Seed cooperative enterprises and provide technical assistance for governance, procurement, and finance.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Worker Ownership & Cooperative Accelerator Act."

SEC. 2. CAPITAL.
Establish a grant/loan pool for co-ops that share equity with workers and meet living wage, housing, and training benchmarks.

SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE.
Fund regional cooperative development centers embedded in land grant universities and worker centers.
```

**Explanation**: Offers alternative ownership options and keeps value in rural communities.

**Challenges**: Governance training and procurement access.

## State Model Legislation

States can enact “Farm Labor Protection Acts” that:

- Require independent housing inspections and fee transparency.
- Strengthen wage theft penalties and provide multilingual complaint hotlines.
- Offer tax credits for employers that upgrade labor standards or support worker ownership.

## Regulatory Framework

- DOL Wage and Hour Division updates rules to define living wage standards, recordkeeping, and housing safety.
- DHS and DOL align on visa portability rules, requiring joint adjudication and shared grievance data.
- USDA and HUD coordinate equity fund disbursements with rural housing dollars.

## Legal Considerations

- Constitutional Issues: Ensure wage and housing mandates respect due process and show rational basis tied to public health.
- Preemption: Federal law should set minimums while leaving states room for stronger protections.
- Enforcement: Civil penalties, debarment for repeat violators, and private rights of action through union or legal aid assistance.
- Sunset & Review: GAO reports every 5 years on wage compliance, housing, and visa integrity.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Contractor layering | Employers shift obligations to contractors to avoid oversight | High |
| Registry gaming | Employers manipulate portable registry by misreporting wage complaints | Medium |
| Cooperative abuse | Firms claim cooperative status but retain top-down control | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Enforcement gaps | Limited inspectors in remote regions | DOL funding constraints |
| Data opacity | No federal database for housing and wage complaints | Fragmented reporting |
| Workforce financing | Lack of patient capital for worker-led enterprises | Limited rural venture funds |

### Rectification Procedures

1. Require contractor registration and extend wage theft statutes to intermediaries.
2. Fund bilingual grievance hotlines and integrate them with registry data to detect gaming.
3. Create cooperative governance standards and require third-party audits.

### General Implementation Concerns

Ensure multi-agency oversight to manage complex funding streams and avoid conflicting guidance.
