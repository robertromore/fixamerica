# Farm Labor & Equity: Root Causes

## Overview

Farmworker exploitation persists because multiple interlocking systems—legal exclusions, immigration policy, economic pressures, and enforcement failures—create conditions where workers lack power and employers face few consequences. Understanding these root causes reveals why incremental reforms have failed to fundamentally change conditions.

## Legal and Statutory Causes

### Federal Labor Law Exclusions

**National Labor Relations Act (1935)**

| Coverage | Agricultural Workers |
|----------|---------------------|
| Right to organize | Excluded |
| Collective bargaining | Excluded |
| Protection from retaliation | Excluded |
| NLRB enforcement | Not available |

**Result**

- Workers cannot legally organize without state-level law
- Employers can fire organizing workers
- No federal mechanism for union recognition
- Only California, New York have state agricultural labor relations laws

**Fair Labor Standards Act**

| Provision | Agricultural Coverage |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Minimum wage | Covered (with exceptions) |
| Overtime | Excluded (states may cover) |
| Child labor | Weaker protections |
| Piece rate | Complications with minimum wage |

**Occupational Safety and Health Act**

| Coverage | Agricultural Limitation |
|----------|------------------------|
| General duty clause | Applies |
| Field sanitation | Covered (farms 11+ workers) |
| Temporary labor camps | Limited standards |
| Pesticide exposure | Covered under WPS, not OSHA |
| Heat stress | No federal standard |

### Immigration Status as Control

**H-2A Program Structure**

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Employer-tied visas | Workers cannot change jobs |
| Employer recruits | Workers selected by employer |
| Employer houses | Workers dependent for housing |
| Employer transports | Mobility controlled |
| Limited legal aid | Rights hard to enforce |

**Undocumented Workers**

| Vulnerability | Effect |
|---------------|--------|
| Deportation threat | Deters complaints |
| Limited legal recourse | Hard to file claims |
| Document requirements | Excludes from programs |
| Employer leverage | "Voluntary" compliance |

---

## Economic Causes

### Agricultural Market Pressures

**Price Squeeze**

| Factor | Effect on Labor |
|--------|-----------------|
| Buyer concentration | Farmers squeezed, pressure wages |
| Commodity pricing | Labor = variable cost to cut |
| International competition | Imports set price floor |
| Consumer price sensitivity | Limits pass-through |

**Labor as Cost**

| Cost Category | Share of Production Cost |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Fruits/vegetables | 35-50%+ |
| Dairy | 15-30% |
| Field crops | 5-15% |
| Result | Labor reduction prioritized |

### Contractor Exploitation

**Why Contractors**

| Employer Benefit | Worker Cost |
|------------------|-------------|
| Reduced liability | No direct employment relationship |
| Wage flexibility | Piece rate manipulation |
| Seasonal variability | No year-round commitment |
| Compliance buffer | Contractor absorbs violations |

**Contractor Abuses**

| Practice | Prevalence |
|----------|------------|
| Wage theft | Common |
| Fee extraction | Transportation, housing, equipment |
| Document manipulation | Creating dependency |
| Blacklisting | Punishing complaints |

## Institutional Causes

### Enforcement Resource Constraints

**DOL Wage and Hour Division**

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Agricultural investigators | Limited specialization |
| Investigations per year | Thousands of farms uninspected |
| Average penalty | Often less than stolen wages |
| Complaint-driven | Vulnerable workers don't complain |

**OSHA Agricultural Enforcement**

| Limitation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Small farm exemption | <11 workers exempt from many rules |
| Limited ag inspectors | Rural areas underserved |
| No heat standard | Leading cause of death |
| Pesticide deferred to EPA | Enforcement gaps |

### H-2A Program Administration

**DOL Certification Process**

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Employer-side process | Workers not represented |
| Recruitment oversight | Limited |
| Contract enforcement | Post-hoc complaints only |
| Housing inspection | Inconsistent |

**Visa Dependency**

- Workers must leave if fired
- Complaints risk future eligibility
- Recruitment debt creates pressure
- Legal services limited

---

## Political Economy Causes

### Agricultural Employer Political Power

**Lobbying Influence**

| Actor | Position |
|-------|----------|
| Farm Bureau | Oppose labor protections |
| Western Growers | H-2A expansion, no legalization |
| Dairy Farmers | Year-round visa access |
| Farm Labor Contractors | Status quo |

**Congressional Dynamics**

- Agriculture committees dominated by farm-state members
- Labor committees have limited agricultural jurisdiction
- Immigration committees focused on enforcement
- No coherent farmworker policy venue

### Worker Political Powerlessness

**Barriers to Voice**

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Non-citizen status | Cannot vote |
| Geographic dispersion | Hard to organize constituency |
| Migration patterns | Not in one place long enough |
| Language barriers | Limited political participation |
| Fear of retaliation | Silence |

**Weakened Unions**

- UFW decline since 1970s peak
- Limited new organizing
- NLRA exclusion prevents federal protection
- State laws limited to few states

## Structural Discrimination

### Historical Legacy

**Racialized Exclusion**

| Era | Targeted Group | Mechanism |
|-----|----------------|-----------|
| Pre-1865 | Enslaved Black people | Chattel slavery |
| 1865-1960s | Black sharecroppers | Debt peonage, discrimination |
| 1880s-1940s | Asian immigrants | Exclusion laws |
| 1940s-present | Mexican/Central American | Guest worker programs |

**New Deal Compromise**

- Southern Democrats demanded agricultural exclusion
- Protected racial hierarchy in agriculture
- Exclusions never fully reversed
- Legacy continues in law

### Current Discrimination

**Wage Gaps**

| Group | Compared to White Workers |
|-------|---------------------------|
| Latino farmworkers | Significantly lower |
| Women farmworkers | Lower + harassment |
| Indigenous workers | Lower + language barriers |

**Occupational Segregation**

- Supervisory positions predominantly white
- Skilled work reserved for permanent employees
- Seasonal work predominantly immigrant
- Advancement paths limited

## Interconnections and Feedback Loops

### The Vulnerability Trap

```text
Immigration status → employer control →
fear of complaints → violations unpunished →
employers continue practices → workers more vulnerable
```

### The Enforcement Gap

```text
Limited resources → few investigations →
low penalties → no deterrence →
violations continue → workers don't report →
no data on problem → resources stay limited
```

### The Political Powerlessness Loop

```text
Non-citizen workforce → cannot vote →
elected officials unaccountable →
laws favor employers →
workers remain vulnerable
```

### The Market Pressure Loop

```text
Buyer concentration → price pressure on farms →
farms cut labor costs →
workers more vulnerable →
no consumer awareness →
buyers maintain pressure
```

## Why Traditional Reforms Fail

### Enforcement-Only Approaches

| Approach | Limitation |
|----------|------------|
| More investigators | Workers still won't complain |
| Higher penalties | Employers absorb as cost |
| Complaint hotlines | Fear of retaliation |
| Employer audits | Temporary compliance |

### Immigration-Only Approaches

| Approach | Limitation |
|----------|------------|
| Guest worker expansion | More employer control |
| Legalization | May not improve conditions |
| Enforcement | Workers become more vulnerable |
| Border security | Shifts to visa overstay |

### Sector-Specific Limits

| Approach | Limitation |
|----------|------------|
| Agricultural overtime | Employers reduce hours |
| Housing standards | Employers stop providing housing |
| Organizing rights | Few organizers, weak enforcement |
| Certification programs | Consumer premium limited |

---

## Intervention Points

### High-Leverage Opportunities

1. **NLRA coverage**: Federal organizing rights would fundamentally shift power
2. **Portable visas**: Breaking employer control over immigration status
3. **Joint employer liability**: Contractors and growers both accountable
4. **Worker board representation**: Governance voice in standard-setting
5. **Funded legal services**: Enable rights enforcement

### Structural vs. Incremental

| Approach | Examples | Potential |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Structural | NLRA coverage, visa portability | High but politically difficult |
| Incremental | Standards, enforcement | Limited without structural change |
| Worker power | Organizing, worker centers | Necessary complement |
