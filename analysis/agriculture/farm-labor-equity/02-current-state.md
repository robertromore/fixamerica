# Farm Labor & Equity: Current State

## Overview

The American agricultural labor system is under severe strain. Chronic worker shortages persist across fruit, vegetable, and horticulture sectors despite rapidly growing use of the H-2A guest worker program. When seasonal workers do arrive, delays in processing, recruitment fees, and housing shortfalls drive up costs and compress harvest windows. Meanwhile, farmworkers remain among the most vulnerable workers in America—earning poverty-level wages, living in substandard housing, and lacking basic labor protections that other workers take for granted.
