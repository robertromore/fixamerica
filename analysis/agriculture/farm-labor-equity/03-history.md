# Farm Labor & Equity: History

## Overview

The history of farm labor in America is marked by deliberate exclusion from labor protections, exploitation of vulnerable populations, and persistent struggles for dignity and fair treatment. Understanding this history reveals why today's farmworkers remain among the most vulnerable workers in the economy.

## Early Agricultural Labor (Before 1900)

### Slavery and Its Legacy

**Plantation Agriculture**

- Southern agriculture built on enslaved labor
- After emancipation, sharecropping and tenant farming perpetuated exploitation
- Convict leasing provided forced labor into 20th century
- Black farmers systematically dispossessed of land

**Early Immigration**

| Era | Group | Region | Treatment |
|-----|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1850s-80s | Chinese immigrants | California | Built railroads, then agriculture |
| 1880s | Chinese Exclusion Act | National | Barred immigration |
| 1880s-1900s | Japanese immigrants | West Coast | Replaced Chinese workers |

### Labor Organizing Begins

**Early Efforts**

- Knights of Labor attempted organizing (1880s)
- Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) organized farmworkers (1910s)
- Japanese and Mexican farmworkers organized in California
- Violent suppression of organizing common

## New Deal Exclusions (1930s-1940s)

### The Great Exclusion

**National Labor Relations Act (1935)**

- Established right to organize, collective bargaining
- Explicitly excluded agricultural workers
- Southern Democrats demanded exclusion to maintain racial hierarchy
- Domestic workers also excluded

**Fair Labor Standards Act (1938)**

- Established minimum wage, overtime
- Excluded agricultural workers
- Same political dynamics as NLRA
- Partial coverage added later but gaps remain

**Social Security Act (1935)**

- Initially excluded agricultural workers
- Coverage gradually extended (1950s)
- Administration discrimination persisted

### Bracero Program Origins

**World War II Labor Shortages**

| Year | Development | Effect |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1942 | Bracero Program begins | Mexican workers recruited |
| 1943-45 | Wartime labor shortages | Program expands |
| 1946-64 | Program continues post-war | Millions of workers |

**How It Worked**

- Bilateral agreement with Mexico
- Workers brought for temporary agricultural work
- Employer-tied visas created control
- Widespread violations of contract terms
- Wages withheld, poor housing common

## Civil Rights Era (1950s-1970s)

### Bracero Program Abuses and End

**Documented Problems**

| Issue | Scale |
|-------|-------|
| Wage theft | Systematic |
| Housing conditions | Substandard |
| Workplace safety | Pesticide exposure |
| Contract violations | Routine |

**Program End (1964)**

- Labor and civil rights pressure
- CBS documentary "Harvest of Shame" (1960)
- Mexican government concerns
- Program terminated, H-2 program continued

### United Farm Workers Movement

| Year | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1962 | National Farm Workers Association founded | Base organization |
| 1965 | Delano grape strike begins | National attention |
| 1966 | Merger creates UFW | Combined strength |
| 1968 | Chavez 25-day fast | National movement |
| 1970 | Grape contracts signed | First major victory |

**Movement Tactics**

- Strikes and boycotts
- Marches and pilgrimages

## Immigration Policy Era (1980s-2000s)

### Immigration Reform and Control Act (1986)

**Key Provisions**

| Provision | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| I-9 verification | Employer documentation requirements |
| Employer sanctions | Penalties for hiring undocumented |
| Legalization programs | Path for some farmworkers |
| Special Agricultural Workers | ~1.1 million legalized |

**Unintended Consequences**

- Document fraud increased
- Workers became more vulnerable
- Enforcement focused on workers, not employers
- Created two-tier workforce

### H-2A Program Evolution

**Program Growth**

| Year | H-2A Certifications |
|------|---------------------|
| 1990 | ~20,000 |
| 2000 | ~45,000 |
| 2010 | ~79,000 |
| 2020 | ~275,000 |
| 2023 | ~370,000+ |

**Why Growth**

- Domestic labor shortages
- Immigration enforcement
- Employer preference for controlled workforce
- Regulatory changes eased access

## Contemporary Era (2000s-Present)

### State-Level Progress

**California Advances**

| Year | Law | Provision |
|------|-----|-----------|
| 2016 | AB 1066 | Overtime for farmworkers |
| 2019 | AB 5 | Worker classification |
| 2022 | AB 2183 | Union election procedures |

**Other State Action**

| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Washington | Overtime, heat protections |

### Federal Inaction

**Failed Reforms**

| Year | Bill | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| 2013 | AgJOBS provisions | Died in Congress |
| 2019 | Farm Workforce Modernization Act | House passed, Senate stalled |
| 2021 | Farm Workforce Modernization Act | House passed again |
| 2023 | Continued negotiations | Unresolved |

### COVID-19 and Essential Workers

**Pandemic Impacts**

| Impact | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Designated essential | Required to work |
| High infection rates | Congregate housing, work conditions |
| Limited protections | No paid sick leave |
| Visibility | Temporary attention to conditions |

**Policy Responses**

- Some emergency housing standards
- Limited access to relief funds
- Increased advocacy attention
- Most gains temporary

## Historical Patterns

### Recurring Themes

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Exploitation of vulnerable groups | Enslaved people → immigrants → guest workers |
| Legal exclusion | NLRA, FLSA, Social Security |
| Employer control over immigration status | Bracero → H-2A |
| Organizing met with violence | 1910s, 1930s, 1960s |
| State action ahead of federal | California, Washington, New York |

### What Has Changed

1. **Some legal coverage**: Minimum wage (partial), workers' compensation (varies)
2. **State-level gains**: Overtime in some states, organizing rights
3. **Public awareness**: Periodic attention to conditions
4. **Worker organization**: UFW, worker centers, advocacy groups

### What Hasn't Changed

1. **Federal exclusion from NLRA**: No national organizing rights
2. **Enforcement gaps**: Limited DOL, OSHA capacity
3. **Immigration leverage**: Guest worker dependency
4. **Housing problems**: Persistent substandard conditions
5. **Wage theft**: Ongoing, difficult to address
