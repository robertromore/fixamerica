## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Housing-First Compliance Package

- **Bridges**: Conservative, Centrist, Liberal
- **Core agreement**: Upgrade housing with clear compliance targets.
- **Policy**: Grants tied to housing inspections and wage transparency, phased over two years.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept phased enforcement; conservatives accept reporting.
- **Viability**: High; broad agreement on housing safety.

### Compromise 2: Portable Visas with Guardrails

- **Bridges**: Centrist, Liberal, Conservative
- **Core agreement**: Portability with strong registry and employer accountability.
- **Policy**: Limited portability windows with verified job offers and grievance protections.
- **Concessions**: Workers accept registry; employers accept transparency.
- **Viability**: Medium; depends on DHS/DOL implementation.

### Compromise 3: Cooperative Accelerator Pilot

- **Bridges**: Progressive, Populist, Religious Right
- **Core agreement**: Worker ownership pilots to improve retention.
- **Policy**: Regional pilots with matched funding and governance training.
- **Concessions**: Limited scope to pilot regions.
- **Viability**: Medium-high; low controversy if optional.

## Strategic Implications

- Most viable coalition centers on housing upgrades and workforce training.
- Key obstacle is disagreement over portability and enforcement strength.
- Bad-faith risk appears limited; focus on transparent compliance metrics.
- Recommended approach: pass Equity & Infrastructure Act first, then phase in Portable Workforce Act with pilot registry.
