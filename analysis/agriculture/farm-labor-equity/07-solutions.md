# Farm Labor & Equity: Solutions

## Overview

Addressing farm labor inequity requires ending the historical exclusions that have left farmworkers outside basic labor protections, reforming guest worker programs to give workers genuine agency, and building enforcement systems that can actually protect vulnerable workers. The solutions below range from extending existing rights to farmworkers through fundamental restructuring of agricultural labor relations.

| **Employer responsibility** | Those who benefit from labor bear responsibility for treatment |
| **Cultural competence** | Programs must work for multilingual, mobile populations |
| **Economic viability** | Reforms must allow sustainable farm operations |

### Strategic Framework

| Strategy | Components |
|----------|------------|
| **Extend legal protections** | NLRA coverage, overtime, child labor reform |
| **Reform guest worker programs** | Portability, independent housing, enforcement |
| **Build enforcement capacity** | Funding, inter-agency coordination, whistleblower protection |
