# Farm Labor & Equity: Stakeholders

## Overview

Farm labor policy involves a complex web of stakeholders with often divergent interests: farmworkers seeking dignity and fair compensation, employers balancing labor costs against viability, government agencies with overlapping jurisdictions, advocacy organizations, and communities affected by agricultural labor practices. Understanding these stakeholder dynamics is essential for designing reforms that can build sufficient coalitions to overcome entrenched opposition.
