# Farm Finance & Land Access: Overview

## Executive Summary

Farm finance and land access addresses the capital and real estate dynamics that determine who can enter, stay, or expand in agriculture. This subtopic traces the role of credit, debt, land prices, succession planning, and speculative pressures that squeeze beginning, BIPOC, and leverage-light producers. With average farmland values rising nearly 30% since 2015 and institutional investors increasingly entering agricultural real estate markets, the barriers to farm ownership have become formidable—particularly for young, beginning, and historically underserved farmers.

Policy must expand affordable capital, reduce speculation, and support transition planning so new generations can acquire land, rebuild equity, and invest in regenerative practices. That also means rethinking risk management, credit scoring, and tax incentives that currently favor scale and incumbency over stewardship and diversity.

## Key Questions

### Capital Access and Affordability

- How can public and private finance align to support long-term stewardship rather than annual production?
- Which loan products and credit scoring adjustments help beginning, tenant, and BIPOC farmers compete for land?
- What role should CDFIs, cooperative lenders, and mission-driven capital play?
- How can down payment requirements be reduced without increasing default risk?

### Land Markets and Speculation

- How can farmland tax policies discourage speculation while encouraging conservation easements and family transfers?
- What transparency measures would reveal beneficial ownership and curb foreign and institutional accumulation?
- How do land values in different regions respond to policy interventions?
- What mechanisms can stabilize land prices without distorting agricultural markets?

### Succession and Transition

- What succession planning resources help retiring farmers transfer land to diverse heirs or cooperatives?
- How can heirs' property issues be resolved to enable farm continuity?
- What incentives encourage retiring farmers to sell or lease to beginning farmers?
- How do estate taxes and stepped-up basis affect intergenerational transfers?

### Integration with Other Priorities

- How do we integrate land access strategies with climate resilience funding so new stewards can invest in adaptive infrastructure?
- What connections exist between land access, conservation easements, and working lands programs?
- How can housing and rural development programs support farm worker access to land?

## Why This Matters

### Economic Significance

| Impact | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| **Farm real estate value** | $3.4+ trillion |
| **Annual farmland transactions** | ~$30 billion |
| **Farm operator household income** | Median ~$95,000 (includes off-farm income) |
| **Rural wealth concentration** | Land represents primary asset for most farm families |
| **Credit system size** | $400+ billion Farm Credit, $50+ billion FSA |

### Equity and Demographics

Without equitable access to land and affordable capital, agriculture risks further consolidation, loss of rural wealth, and fewer innovations. The current system perpetuates historical inequities:

- Black farmers declined from 14% to 1.3% of farmers between 1920 and 2022
- Indigenous peoples lost 90% of their land base through broken treaties and forced allotments
- Women farmers have historically faced discrimination in lending
- Beginning farmers compete against established operators with generational equity

### Climate and Stewardship

Land access directly affects climate outcomes:

- Secure tenure enables long-term investments in soil health and carbon sequestration
- New farmers often bring innovative, sustainable approaches
- Absentee ownership reduces stewardship incentives
- Speculative holdings may prioritize short-term extraction over long-term health

### Rural Communities

Farm ownership patterns shape rural economies:

- Owner-operators spend locally and maintain community ties
- Absentee ownership drains wealth from rural areas
- Land consolidation reduces population and services
- Diverse farm ownership supports resilient local economies

## Current Debate

### Financing Approaches

| Position | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| **Expand public lending** | FSA can reach underserved borrowers private markets won't serve |
| **Leverage private capital** | Public funds should de-risk private investment, not replace it |
| **Mission-driven finance** | CDFIs and cooperatives understand agricultural communities |
| **Market-based solutions** | Reduce regulation to allow innovative lending products |

### Land Market Interventions

| Position | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| **Anti-speculation measures** | Transfer taxes and ownership limits needed to preserve affordability |
| **Property rights primacy** | Landowners have right to sell to highest bidder |
| **Transparency first** | Disclosure requirements before ownership restrictions |
| **Conservation easements** | Voluntary programs better than mandates |

### Targeting and Equity

| Position | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| **Race-conscious programs** | History requires targeted remedies for discrimination |
| **Income-based targeting** | Economic need should determine eligibility |
| **Universal programs** | All farmers benefit from improved access |
| **Local control** | States and regions should design their own approaches |
