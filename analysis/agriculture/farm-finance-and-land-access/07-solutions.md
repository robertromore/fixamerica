# Farm Finance & Land Access: Solutions

## Overview

Expanding farm finance and land access requires a comprehensive approach that addresses capital barriers, moderates land market pressures, supports succession planning, and ensures equitable access for beginning and underserved farmers. The solutions below combine enhanced federal lending, tax policy reform, land market transparency, and innovative ownership models to break down barriers while respecting property rights and market dynamics. These reforms can be implemented through administrative action, appropriations, farm bill provisions, and tax legislation.
