# Farm Finance & Land Access: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Transforming farm finance and land access requires sequenced implementation that builds momentum through early wins while laying groundwork for more substantial reforms. This roadmap prioritizes administrative actions that can proceed immediately, appropriations requests that build program capacity, farm bill provisions that authorize new programs, and tax legislation that reshapes incentives. Success depends on sustained advocacy, coalition maintenance, and adaptive management as political conditions evolve.

---

## Strategic Approach

### Theory of Change

Combine capital mobilization, technical assistance, and transparency to keep land affordable and ensure new stewards bring climate-smart management. The roadmap phases new funds, disclosure rules, and performance metrics so reforms stay manageable and build political support through demonstrated success.

### Sequencing Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Administrative first** | Maximize existing authority before seeking legislation |
| **Build capacity** | Staff and infrastructure before major new programs |
| **Demonstrate success** | Pilots and demonstrations inform broader rollout |
| **Coalition maintenance** | Keep diverse stakeholders engaged throughout |
| **Adaptability** | Build in review and adjustment mechanisms |
| **Multiple tracks** | Pursue administrative, appropriations, and legislative simultaneously |

### Political Windows

| Window | Opportunity |
|--------|-------------|
| **Farm bill reauthorization** | Major legislation opportunity every 5 years |
| **Appropriations cycle** | Annual opportunity for funding increases |
| **Tax legislation** | Less predictable; requires major bills or reconciliation |
| **Administrative transitions** | New administrations can shift USDA priorities |
| **Crisis response** | Economic stress can create openings for reform |
