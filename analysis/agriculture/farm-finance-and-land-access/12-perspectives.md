## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Succession-First Credit Package

- **Bridges**: Conservative, Centrist, Liberal
- **Core agreement**: Expand credit and coaching to keep family farms viable.
- **Policy**: FSA risk-sharing plus lender coaching requirements and succession planning grants.
- **Concessions**: Reformers delay surcharges; conservatives accept expanded TA.
- **Viability**: High; strongest shared interest.

### Compromise 2: Land Transition Fund with Local Governance

- **Bridges**: Centrist, Populist, Progressive
- **Core agreement**: Local control over land purchases and stewardship covenants.
- **Policy**: State-led boards with federal matching funds, local scoring criteria, and transparency.
- **Concessions**: Federal oversight limited to outcomes; locals accept disclosure rules.
- **Viability**: High; balances local control with scale.

### Compromise 3: Targeted Anti-Speculation Pilot

- **Bridges**: Liberal, Progressive, Populist
- **Core agreement**: Focus on high-pressure counties and clear exemptions.
- **Policy**: Surcharges only in counties with rapid price growth; exemptions for family transfers and conservation sales.
- **Concessions**: Narrowed scope; stronger disclosure.
- **Viability**: Medium; depends on state buy-in.

## Strategic Implications

- Most viable coalition centers on credit acceleration and succession planning.
- Key obstacle is opposition to surcharges and resale restrictions.
- Bad-faith risk appears limited; focus on pilot programs with transparent outcomes.
- Recommended approach: pass Credit Accelerator first, then expand Land Transition Fund, and pilot anti-speculation in select regions.
