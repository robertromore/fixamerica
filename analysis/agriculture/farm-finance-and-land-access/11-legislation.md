# Farm Finance and Land Access: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative framework for farm finance and land access aims to address the twin crises of an aging agricultural workforce and insurmountable barriers to entry for new farmers. With the average farmer age approaching 60 and land prices at record highs, the traditional pathway to farm ownership has broken down.

This legislation focuses on three strategic interventions: (1) creating a public land bank to facilitate transfers from retiring to beginning farmers; (2) reforming federal credit programs to serve those the private market rejects; and (3) addressing the specific legacy of discrimination that has stripped land from Black, Indigenous, and other farmers of color. The approach combines direct federal investment with tax incentives to shift the market away from consolidation and toward a diverse, resilient agricultural base.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for farm finance reform. Congress has broad authority under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) to fund agricultural credit and land access programs, and under the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) to regulate agricultural lending markets.*

## Federal Legislation

### The Beginning Farmer and Land Access Act

**Purpose**: To establish a federal land bank and enhanced credit programs to facilitate the transfer of 50 million acres to beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers over the next decade.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Federal Land Access Trust**: Creates a revolving fund to purchase farmland from retiring farmers and lease-to-own it to qualified beginning farmers.
2. **Down Payment Assistance**: Expands FSA down payment loans to cover up to 50% of the purchase price for first-time buyers.
3. **Tax Incentives for Transition**: Provides a capital gains tax exclusion for landowners who sell to beginning or socially disadvantaged farmers.
4. **Student Loan Forgiveness**: Establishes a loan forgiveness program for graduates who commit to farming full-time for 10 years.
5. **Heirs' Property Resolution**: Permanently authorizes and funds legal assistance to clear titles for families with heirs' property issues.

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Creates a "public option" for land transfer, intervening in the market to prevent consolidation by investment firms and ensure land stays in the hands of operators.
- **Section 5**: Updates loan limits to reflect modern land prices, making the FSA's flagship beginning farmer program relevant again.
- **Section 6**: Uses the tax code to incentivize landowners to sell to new farmers rather than the highest bidder (often a developer or consolidation-minded neighbor).
- **Section 7**: Recognizes that student debt is a major barrier to capital access for young farmers, treating farming as public service akin to teaching.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Establish Trust Board | 90 days after enactment | USDA |
| Issue Tax Guidance | 180 days after enactment | IRS |
| Launch Loan Forgiveness | July 1, 2027 | Dept of Education |
| First Land Acquisitions | FY 2027 | USDA Trust |

**Challenges**:

- **Land Prices**: Even with assistance, land may be too expensive for farm income to support debt service.
- **Seller Resistance**: Landowners may prefer cash offers from developers over complex federal programs.

**Refinements**:

- Pair land access with business technical assistance to ensure new farmers can succeed financially.

### The Justice for Black Farmers and Indigenous Land Restoration Act

**Purpose**: To address the history of discrimination within USDA that stripped millions of acres from Black and Indigenous farmers, providing debt relief, land grants, and oversight reform.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Civil Rights Oversight Board**: Establishes an independent board to review civil rights appeals and oversee USDA compliance.
2. **Land Grant Program**: Authorizes USDA to purchase land and grant it to Black and Indigenous farmers to restore the land base.
3. **Debt Relief**: Provides 120% debt relief for outstanding USDA loans held by socially disadvantaged farmers (paying off the loan plus tax liability).
4. **Farm Conservation Corps**: Creates a paid apprenticeship program for socially disadvantaged youth to learn farming skills.
5. **Equity Commission**: Codifies the Equity Commission to provide ongoing accountability.

**Draft Text**:

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To address the history of discrimination in agricultural lending and restore land ownership.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Justice for Black Farmers and Indigenous Land Restoration Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) In 1920, Black farmers owned nearly 20 million acres of farmland; today they own less than 3 million acres due to systemic discrimination and dispossession.
(2) The Pigford v. Glickman consent decree acknowledged USDA discrimination but failed to fully compensate many farmers or restore lost land.
(3) Indigenous communities lost millions of acres through the allotment era and broken treaties, undermining food sovereignty.
(4) Restoring this land base is a matter of justice and economic necessity for rural communities of color.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) ELIGIBLE FARMER.—The term "eligible farmer" means a farmer or rancher who is a member of a socially disadvantaged group as defined in section 2501(a) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990.
(2) BOARD.—The term "Board" means the Civil Rights Oversight Board.

SEC. 4. INDEPENDENT CIVIL RIGHTS OVERSIGHT BOARD.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established an independent Civil Rights Oversight Board within the Department of Agriculture.
(b) AUTHORITY.—The Board shall review all civil rights complaints filed against the Department and have the authority to order corrective action, including debt forgiveness and monetary compensation.

SEC. 5. LAND RESTORATION GRANTS.

(a) PROGRAM.—The Secretary shall establish a program to purchase agricultural land and grant it to eligible Black and Indigenous farmers.
(b) GRANTS.—Grants shall be sufficient to cover the purchase price of the land, up to 160 acres per individual.
(c) EASEMENTS.—Land granted under this section shall be subject to a conservation easement preventing non-agricultural development.

SEC. 6. DEBT RELIEF.

(a) PAYMENTS.—The Secretary shall pay off all outstanding debt for direct and guaranteed farm loans held by eligible farmers as of January 1, 2026.
(b) TAX LIABILITY.—The Secretary shall provide an additional payment equal to 20 percent of the debt amount to cover potential tax liabilities associated with debt forgiveness.

SEC. 7. FARM CONSERVATION CORPS.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary shall establish a Farm Conservation Corps to provide training and apprenticeships to socially disadvantaged youth.
(b) STIPEND.—Participants shall receive a living wage stipend and housing allowance.

SEC. 8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) ANNUAL REPORT.—The Board shall report annually to Congress on the number of complaints received, resolved, and the total compensation awarded.
(b) LAND REPORT.—The Secretary shall report on the acreage restored to Black and Indigenous ownership.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $5,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $5,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $5,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $5,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $5,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Removes civil rights enforcement from the political whims of the Secretary, creating a truly independent watchdog.
- **Section 5**: Directly addresses the wealth gap by transferring assets (land) rather than just income (subsidies).
- **Section 6**: Clears the books for farmers who were set up to fail by discriminatory lending practices, allowing them a fresh start.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Appoint Oversight Board | 60 days after enactment | President/Senate |
| Begin Debt Payments | 90 days after enactment | USDA FSA |
| Launch Land Grant Portal | 180 days after enactment | USDA |

**Challenges**:

- **Legal Challenges**: Race-based programs face strict scrutiny (e.g., *Miller v. Vilsack* blocked ARPA debt relief). Legislation must be carefully crafted to withstand court challenges, potentially using "economic disadvantage" proxies.
- **Implementation Capacity**: FSA offices need training and culture change to deliver these programs fairly.

**Refinements**:

- Include a "socially disadvantaged" definition that relies on a history of discrimination rather than race alone to navigate legal hurdles.

### The Agricultural Credit Modernization Act

**Purpose**: To update the Farm Credit System (FCS) and FSA lending programs to better serve diversified, local, and organic operations that traditional lending models often reject.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Microloan Expansion**: Increases the FSA microloan cap from $50,000 to $100,000 and simplifies the application further.
2. **Whole-Farm Revenue Analysis**: Mandates that FSA and FCS lenders use whole-farm revenue history rather than commodity-specific yield history for loan underwriting.
3. **FCS Mission Expansion**: Requires Farm Credit System institutions to dedicate at least 15% of their portfolio to beginning and small farmers.
4. **Infrastructure Loans**: Creates a dedicated loan fund for on-farm infrastructure (cold storage, processing) essential for local food systems.

**Draft Text**:

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To modernize agricultural lending to support diversified and resilient farming systems.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Agricultural Credit Modernization Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Traditional agricultural lending models are designed for large-scale commodity production and often fail to recognize the profitability of diversified, direct-market farms.
(2) The Farm Credit System, a Government Sponsored Enterprise, has a duty to serve all of agriculture, not just the largest borrowers.
(3) Access to capital for infrastructure is a critical bottleneck for local food systems.

SEC. 3. MICROLOAN EXPANSION.

(a) LIMIT INCREASE.—Section 313(c)(2) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1943(c)(2)) is amended by striking "$50,000" and inserting "$100,000".
(b) STREAMLINING.—The Secretary shall further simplify the application process for microloans to require only essential financial information.

SEC. 4. UNDERWRITING STANDARDS.

(a) WHOLE FARM REVENUE.—The Secretary shall issue regulations requiring the Farm Service Agency to utilize whole-farm revenue history and projected cash flow, including income from value-added products, when underwriting operating and ownership loans.
(b) DIVERSIFIED OPERATIONS.—The Secretary shall develop specific loan valuation guidelines for diversified operations that do not fit standard commodity templates.

SEC. 5. FARM CREDIT SYSTEM MISSION.

(a) REQUIREMENT.—Section 1.1 of the Farm Credit Act of 1971 is amended to require that not less than 15 percent of the total loan volume of each System institution be dedicated to beginning, small, or socially disadvantaged farmers.
(b) ENFORCEMENT.—The Farm Credit Administration shall enforce this requirement through its examination process.

SEC. 6. INFRASTRUCTURE LOAN FUND.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary shall establish a revolving loan fund to provide low-interest loans for on-farm infrastructure, including cold storage, packing sheds, and processing equipment.
(b) TERMS.—Loans shall have a term of up to 10 years and an interest rate of 2 percent.

SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) ANNUAL REPORT.—The Farm Credit Administration shall report annually on the compliance of System institutions with the 15 percent requirement.

SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $110,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $120,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $130,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $140,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3**: Adapts the popular microloan program to inflation and the reality of startup costs.
- **Section 4**: Fixes the "computer says no" problem where profitable vegetable farms are denied loans because they don't grow corn or soy.
- **Section 5**: Holds the GSE accountable to its public mission, preventing it from cherry-picking only the largest, safest loans.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Issue Underwriting Regs | 180 days after enactment | USDA FSA |
| FCA Guidance to System | 90 days after enactment | Farm Credit Admin |
| Infrastructure Fund Live | FY 2027 | USDA RD |

**Challenges**:

- **Lender Resistance**: Banks and FCS institutions resist mandates on their portfolios.
- **Risk Assessment**: New underwriting models require training for loan officers used to commodity templates.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Farmland Preservation and Access Act

**Purpose**: To protect farmland from development and incentivize its transfer to active farmers rather than investors.

**Adaptability Notes**: States with high development pressure (e.g., Northeast, West Coast) should emphasize the easement funding. Agricultural states (e.g., Midwest) should emphasize the tax credits.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Farmland Preservation and Access Act".

SECTION 2. AGRICULTURAL CONSERVATION EASEMENT PROGRAM.
(a) FUNDING.—There is appropriated $20,000,000 annually to the Department of Agriculture for the purchase of agricultural conservation easements.
(b) AFFORDABILITY OPTION.—Easements purchased under this section may include an "Option to Purchase at Agricultural Value" (OPAV) to ensure the land remains affordable for future farmers.

SECTION 3. BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDIT.
(a) CREDIT.—A taxpayer who sells or leases agricultural land, equipment, or livestock to a qualified beginning farmer is eligible for a state income tax credit.
(b) AMOUNT.—The credit shall be equal to:
    (1) 5 percent of the sale price; or
    (2) 10 percent of the gross rental income for each of the first 3 years of a lease.
(c) CAP.—The credit shall not exceed $50,000 per taxpayer per year.

SECTION 4. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL.
(a) REQUIREMENT.—Before agricultural land may be sold to a non-agricultural entity or foreign corporation, it must be offered to qualified beginning farmers or the State Farmland Trust at fair market value.
(b) NOTICE.—Sellers must provide 60 days notice of intent to sell.

SECTION 5. APPROPRIATION.
There is appropriated from the General Fund $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 to carry out this Act.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 2**: Uses easements not just to stop condos, but to lower the price of the land for the farmer (OPAV).
- **Section 3**: Rewards landowners for doing the right thing—renting or selling to a newbie.
- **Section 4**: Slows down the "quiet" transfer of land to developers or foreign funds, giving locals a chance to buy.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Heirs' Property Rules**: Finalize regulations for the Heirs' Property Relending Program to allow more families to clear title. Deadline: 1 year.
2. **Borrower Training**: Update borrower training requirements to include sustainable practices and financial resilience.
3. **Land Tenure Data**: Mandate the collection of foreign ownership data under the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act (AFIDA).

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: Fines for failure to report foreign land ownership (up to 25% of market value).
- **Administrative Actions**: Debarment from USDA programs for discrimination.
- **Private Right of Action**: Restored for civil rights claims against USDA (currently limited).

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Equal Protection**: The *Miller v. Vilsack* injunction against ARPA debt relief showed that race-conscious programs face strict scrutiny. The proposed legislation uses "socially disadvantaged" (a statutory term) but may need to rely on "economic disadvantage" or "history of discrimination" to survive the current Supreme Court.

### Preemption

Federal credit laws generally preempt state usury laws for federal loans. However, state laws regarding land ownership (e.g., corporate farming bans) are generally upheld unless they discriminate against interstate commerce.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance relies on the FSA county office network. Historically, these local committees have been sites of discrimination. The legislation centralizes some authority in the new Oversight Board to mitigate local bias.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **"Paper Farmers"** | Investors create shell entities to qualify for beginning farmer incentives. | High | Require "active personal management" and significant labor contribution. |
| **Easement Valuation** | Landowners inflate easement values to maximize tax breaks. | Medium | Mandate independent, certified appraisals and audit 10% of deals. |
| **Lease Loopholes** | Landowners claim tax credit for short-term leases then evict. | Medium | Require minimum 5-year lease term for tax credit eligibility. |
| **Entity Splitting** | Large farms split into multiple LLCs to bypass payment/loan caps. | High | Apply "attribution" rules that track ownership back to individuals. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Land Price Inflation** | Subsidies capitalize into land values. | Basic economics. | Focus on access/tenure rather than just income support. |
| **Legal Risk** | Race-based relief blocked by courts. | Judicial conservatism. | Use race-neutral proxies (wealth, zip code) where possible. |
| **Bureaucracy** | FSA processes are slow. | Staffing shortages. | Invest in IT modernization and hiring. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Active Farmer Test**: Amend regulations to require 1,000 hours of labor/management per year for eligibility.
2. **Attribution**: Statutorily define "person" to look through all corporate layers to the ultimate beneficial owner.
3. **Proxy Metrics**: If race-based criteria are struck down, trigger a backup provision using "persistent poverty county" and "low-wealth producer" definitions.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **Land Trust**: Review after 10 years to assess market impact.
- **Debt Relief**: One-time action; authority sunsets after execution.
