# Farm Finance & Land Access: Legislation

## Overview

Federal legislation should align capital, tax policy, and disclosure requirements to lower barriers to entry, curb speculation, and reward stewardship. The statutes below mix grants, loans, surcharges, and data mandates to reshape land access.

## Model Federal Bills

### 1. Stewardship-Aligned Land Transition Act

**Purpose**: Fund public-private partnerships that purchase at-risk land and transfer it under resale-restricted covenants to emerging farmers.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Stewardship-Aligned Land Transition Act."

SEC. 2. FUND.
The Secretary shall establish the Land Transition Fund to co-invest with conservancies, cooperatives, and state trusts in land purchases near critical watersheds or climate-vulnerable regions.

SEC. 3. COVENANTS.
Land acquired must be sold with resale controls limiting transfer prices and embedding climate stewardship benchmarks (soil health, water retention, biodiversity).
```

**Explanation**: Keeps high-pressure parcels affordable for new entrants while ensuring stewardship outcomes.

**Challenges**: Determining covenant terms and preventing rent-seeking.

### 2. Equitable Credit Accelerator Act

**Purpose**: Expand FSA direct/guaranteed loans, partner with community banks, and offer coaching/counseling for borrowers lacking traditional collateral.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Equitable Credit Accelerator Act."

SEC. 2. LOANS.
Increase direct loan ceilings by 25% and provide risk-sharing agreements with mission-oriented lenders, especially those serving BIPOC and beginning farmers.

SEC. 3. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.
Fund credit coaches, financial planning software, and bookkeeping training for borrowers receiving accelerator support.
```

**Explanation**: Brings together federal underwriting, private capital, and coaching to diversify the borrower base.

**Challenges**: Recruiting sufficient technical assistance staff and measuring ROI.

### 3. Anti-Speculation & Stewardship Incentive Act

**Purpose**: Impose graduated surcharges on rapid resales by absentee investors and offer tax credits for transfers to trust-based or climate-aligned entities.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Anti-Speculation & Stewardship Incentive Act."

SEC. 2. SURCHARGE.
Owners who sell farmland within five years of purchase (without producing evidence of generational transfer) owe a graduated surcharge of 10% rising to 20% on the most recent appreciation.

SEC. 3. CREDITS.
Transfers to cooperatives, land trusts, or beginning farmers that commit to stewardship receive refundable tax credits.
```

**Explanation**: Deters speculative flipping while rewarding stewardship-minded buyers.

**Challenges**: Compliance monitoring and concerns about liquidity.

## State Model Legislation

States can pass “Land Access & Stewardship Trust Acts” that:

- Create state farmland trust boards to buy, hold, and resell parcels with affordability covenants.
- Provide tax abatements for transfers to beginning/BIPOC farmers who commit to climate-friendly practices.
- Require disclosure of beneficial ownership for transactions above a threshold.

## Regulatory Framework

- USDA FSA must issue guidance defining stewardship performance metrics and alternative collateral options.
- Treasury and IRS should collaborate to implement the surcharge and track capital gains deferrals.
- HUD and EPA can coordinate land trust financing with rural housing and water quality programs.

## Legal Considerations

- Constitutional Issues: Surcharges and covenants must respect takings doctrine while demonstrating a public purpose (equitable land access).
- Preemption Questions: Federal law should allow states to adopt stronger protections and to manage state trust lands without interference.
- Enforcement Mechanisms: Civil penalties for false valuations, clawbacks for covenant violations, and private rights of action for harmed buyers.
- Sunset & Review: Mandatory five-year reviews with GAO reports on outcomes, including stewardship and diversity metrics.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Shell corporations | Absentee investors hide behind LLCs to avoid surcharges | High |
| Covenants circumvented | New owners seek legal loopholes to remove resale restrictions | Medium |
| Credit layering | Applicants stack multiple low-cost loans to obscure true debt | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Data fragmentation | Hard to monitor ownership transfers | County records lag and lack standardization |
| Technical assistance shortage | Borrowers still fail without coaching | Staffing constraints and funding limits |
| Funding volatility | Programs depend on annual appropriations | Lack of multi-year commitments |

### Rectification Procedures

1. Require beneficial-ownership disclosure tied to surcharges and data-sharing across agencies.
2. Build permanent TA corps through USDA partnerships with land grant universities and nonprofits.
3. Secure multiyear appropriations and create revolving funds to reduce annual uncertainty.

### General Implementation Concerns

Need to coordinate surcharge authority with state property tax systems and avoid double-counting benefits across programs.
