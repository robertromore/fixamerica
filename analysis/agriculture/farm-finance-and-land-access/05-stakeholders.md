# Farm Finance & Land Access: Stakeholders

## Overview

Farm finance and land access involves a complex web of stakeholders with competing interests—from beginning farmers struggling to acquire their first acre to institutional investors seeking stable returns, from rural banks serving local communities to federal agencies managing billions in lending programs. Understanding these stakeholders, their interests, and their power is essential for designing reforms that can navigate political realities while expanding access.
