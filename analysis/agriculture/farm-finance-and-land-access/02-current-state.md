# Farm Finance & Land Access: Current State

## Overview

American agriculture faces a growing affordability crisis as land values climb, interest rates rise, and capital flows favor established operators and institutional investors over beginning and underserved farmers. Despite record farm real estate values and a historically low aggregate debt-to-asset ratio, these sector-wide statistics mask severe access barriers for those trying to enter farming or expand modest operations. The current financial landscape reflects decades of consolidation, tax policies that favor scale, and lending structures designed for different agricultural eras.
