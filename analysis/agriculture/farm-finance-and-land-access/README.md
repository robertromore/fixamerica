# Farm Finance & Land Access: Overview

Farm finance and land access addresses the capital and real estate dynamics that determine who can enter, stay, or expand in agriculture. This subtopic traces the role of credit, debt, land prices, succession planning, and speculative pressures that squeeze beginning, BIPOC, and leverage-light producers. With average farmland values rising nearly 30% since 2015 and institutional investors increasingly entering agricultural real estate markets, the barriers to farm ownership have become formidable—particularly for young, beginning, and historically underserved farmers.
