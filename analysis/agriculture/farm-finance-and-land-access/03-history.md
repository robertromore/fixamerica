# Farm Finance & Land Access: History

## Overview

The history of farm finance and land access in America is a story of recurring crises, government interventions, and structural shifts that have progressively concentrated land ownership while making entry into farming increasingly difficult. Understanding this history reveals why today's challenges are so entrenched.

## Early American Land Policy (1785-1862)

### The Land Ordinance System

**Founding Vision**

- Jefferson's vision of agrarian democracy
- Public land sales to fund government
- Rectangular survey system established 1785
- Goal: widespread yeoman farmer ownership

**Reality vs. Ideal**

| Policy Intent | Actual Outcome |
|---------------|----------------|
| Small farmer ownership | Speculators bought large tracts |
| Affordable prices | Minimum purchases too large for poor |
| Orderly settlement | Land fraud and disputes common |
| Democratic distribution | Wealthy had advantages |

### The Homestead Act (1862)

**The Promise**

- 160 acres free to settlers who improved land
- Five-year residency requirement
- Opened western territories
- Peak of agrarian democratic vision

**The Limitations**

- 160 acres insufficient for arid western farming
- Women and minorities faced barriers
- Speculators and railroads acquired vast holdings
- Native American lands seized for distribution

## Building the Farm Credit System (1900-1940)

### The Credit Problem

**Why Farmers Needed Help**

- Commercial banks avoided agricultural loans
- Seasonal income didn't match loan terms
- High interest rates in rural areas
- Crop failures could bankrupt families

**Early Solutions**

| Year | Development | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| 1908 | Country Life Commission | Studied rural credit needs |
| 1913 | Federal Reserve Act | Limited agricultural provisions |
| 1916 | Federal Farm Loan Act | Created Farm Credit System |

### Federal Farm Loan Act (1916)

**Structure Created**

- Federal Land Banks for long-term mortgages
- Joint Stock Land Banks (private, later abolished)
- National Farm Loan Associations (farmer-owned)
- 12 regional districts

**How It Worked**

- Farmers formed local associations
- Associations borrowed from Federal Land Banks
- Banks raised capital through bond sales
- Government provided initial capitalization

### Great Depression and New Deal (1929-1940)

**The Crisis**

- Farm prices collapsed 50%+
- Land values fell dramatically
- Massive foreclosures
- Rural bank failures

**Government Response**

| Year | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1933 | Farm Credit Administration created | Coordinate farm credit |
| 1933 | Emergency Farm Mortgage Act | Refinance distressed loans |
| 1935 | Resettlement Administration | Help tenant farmers |
| 1937 | Farm Security Administration | Loans to family farmers |
| 1937 | Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act | Land purchase assistance |

**Legacy Programs**

- FSA direct and guaranteed loans established
- Emergency loan programs created
- Credit counseling introduced
- Foundation for modern farm safety net

## Post-War Expansion and Consolidation (1945-1980)

### The Golden Age of American Agriculture

**Structural Changes**

- Mechanization reduced labor needs
- Farm size increased dramatically
- Number of farms declined
- Productivity surged

**Land Market Trends**

| Decade | Farmland Value Change | Key Driver |
|--------|----------------------|------------|
| 1950s | Moderate increase | Post-war stability |
| 1960s | Steady appreciation | Farm program payments |
| 1970s | Rapid inflation | Export boom, speculation |

### Credit Expansion

**Farm Credit System Growth**

- Expanded lending authority
- Production Credit Associations added
- Banks for Cooperatives established
- Market share increased

**Commercial Bank Entry**

- Banks competed for farm loans
- Aggressive lending practices
- Land as collateral encouraged borrowing
- Seeds of 1980s crisis planted

### Export Boom and Land Speculation (1970s)

**What Happened**

- Soviet grain purchases opened markets
- Nixon administration encouraged exports
- "Get big or get out" mentality
- Land prices doubled, then doubled again

**Warning Signs Ignored**

- Debt-to-asset ratios climbed
- Cash flow often negative
- Speculation exceeded productive value
- Farmers borrowed against paper gains

---

## The Farm Debt Crisis (1980-1990)

### The Collapse

**Triggers**

- Federal Reserve raised interest rates (1979)
- Soviet grain embargo (1980)
- Strong dollar hurt exports
- Land values fell 30-60%

**Scale of Crisis**

| Metric | Peak to Trough |
|--------|----------------|
| Farmland values | -60% in some states |
| Farm debt | $215 billion (1984) |
| Farm bankruptcies | Tripled |
| Rural bank failures | 300+ banks |

### Human Cost

**Who Suffered**

- Young farmers with recent land purchases
- Farmers who expanded in 1970s
- Rural communities dependent on agriculture
- Suicide rates spiked in farm country

**Policy Responses**

| Year | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1985 | Farm Credit System bailout | Prevent system collapse |
| 1986 | Agricultural Credit Act | Restructure troubled loans |
| 1987 | FmHA debt restructuring | Mandatory mediation |
| 1988 | State mediation programs | Help farmers negotiate |

### Lessons Learned

**What Changed**

- More conservative lending standards
- Stress testing for interest rate changes
- Mediation before foreclosure
- Recognition of systemic risk

**What Didn't Change**

- Land concentration continued
- Entry barriers increased
- Tax incentives for land holding remained
- Speculation returned when prices recovered

---

## Modern Era (1990-Present)

### Consolidation Accelerates

**Trends**

| Metric | 1990 | 2020 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Number of farms | 2.1M | 2.0M | -5% |
| Average farm size | 460 acres | 445 acres | Similar |
| Large farms (% of production) | 50% | 75%+ | Concentration |
| Beginning farmers (% of operators) | 12% | 8% | Decline |

### Land Values Resume Climb

**Price Drivers**

- Low interest rates (1990s-2020s)
- Biofuel mandates (corn demand)
- Foreign investment
- Investor interest in farmland
- Limited supply, growing demand

**Regional Variation**

| Region | 2000-2020 Land Value Change |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Corn Belt | +250% |
| Northern Plains | +200% |
| Delta | +150% |
| Pacific | +300% |

### Beginning Farmer Challenges

**Barriers to Entry**

- Land costs require $1M+ for viable operation
- Credit history requirements exclude new entrants
- Student debt burdens would-be farmers
- Competition from investors and established operators

**Policy Responses**

| Program | Purpose | Effectiveness |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| FSA Beginning Farmer Loans | Subsidized credit | Helps some, limited funding |
| Beginning Farmer Tax Credit | State-level incentives | Modest impact |
| Land Link Programs | Match retiring/beginning | Small scale |
| Conservation Easements | Reduce land costs | Niche application |

### Discrimination and Equity Issues

**Historical Discrimination**

- USDA systematically denied loans to Black farmers
- *Pigford v. Glickman* (1999) settlement
- *Keepseagle* settlement for Native Americans
- Ongoing disparities in loan approval rates

**Current Challenges**

- Wealth gap limits down payments
- Credit history requirements
- Cultural barriers to USDA programs
- Distrust based on historic treatment

- Labor shortages
- Market volatility
- Emergency assistance programs

**Climate Pressures**

- Adaptation investments required

### Inflation Reduction Act (2022)

**Provisions**

- Conservation program funding
- Climate-smart practice incentives
- Equity provisions (partially blocked)

### 2023-2024 Farm Bill Debates

**Key Issues**

## Historical Lessons

### What Has Worked

1. **Cooperative credit systems** - Farm Credit System survived 1980s with restructuring
2. **Mediation programs** - Better outcomes than foreclosure for all parties
3. **Direct lending** - FSA fills gaps commercial lenders won't
4. **Technical assistance** - Credit counseling improves outcomes

### What Has Failed

1. **Market-only approaches** - Private credit retreats in crises
2. **Ignoring systemic risk** - 1980s crisis was predictable
3. **Discriminatory administration** - USDA's history of bias
4. **Assuming land appreciation continues** - Speculation creates bubbles

### Recurring Patterns

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Boom-bust cycles | 1920s, 1970s-80s, 2000s |
| Consolidation after crisis | Post-Depression, post-1980s |
| Government as lender of last resort | New Deal, 1980s bailouts |
| Structural barriers for new entrants | Every era |
