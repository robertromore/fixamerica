# Agriculture Policy: Legislation

## Overview

This section outlines how to turn the strategic priorities into law—pairing conservation, labor, and infrastructure investments with regulatory updates that hold large actors accountable while supporting small farms.

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments are required; Congress has ample Spending Clause authority to fund agriculture, infrastructure, and conservation, and Commerce Clause authority over interstate markets.

## Federal Legislation

### Resilient Farmland Investment Act

**Purpose**: Invest in regenerative infrastructure, soil health technical assistance, and rural broadband linked to climate resilience.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Resilient Farmland Investment Act".

SEC. 2. SOIL HEALTH GRANTS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Agriculture shall award competitive grants to states that commit to measurable soil carbon, erosion, and nutrient runoff outcomes.
(b) TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.—Funds shall support conservation planners, high-resolution mapping, and mentorship networks for beginning farmers.
```

**Explanation**: Directs federal dollars toward measurable outcomes and ensures technical capacity at the state level.

**Challenges**: Requires standardized metrics and robust measurement.

**Refinements**: Tie grants to workforce development and rural broadband deployment.

### National Farm Workforce Equity Act

**Purpose**: Strengthen worker protections, housing, and immigration stability for farm laborers.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "National Farm Workforce Equity Act".

SEC. 2. WAGE AND HOUSING STANDARDS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Employers participating in federal programs shall provide housing that meets federal health standards and pay at least the local living wage.
(b) GUEST-WORKER PROGRAM.—Modernize the H-2A program with streamlined permits, portability between employers, and anti-retaliation protections.
```

**Explanation**: Conditions federal support on fair labor practices and aligns workforce policy with long-term planning.

**Challenges**: Employer pushback and administrative complexity.

**Refinements**: Offer wage subsidies or tax credits tied to compliance.

### Food Systems Supply Chain Security Act

**Purpose**: Expand domestic processing, cold storage, and transportation capacity for fruits, vegetables, and protein.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Food Systems Supply Chain Security Act".

SEC. 2. PROCESSING GRANTS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Agriculture shall award grants and loan guarantees for cooperative and worker-owned processing facilities.
(b) LOCAL PROCUREMENT.—Department of Defense, USDA, and SNAP-Education programs shall prioritize procurement from certified resilient suppliers.
```

**Explanation**: Moves beyond commodity price supports to ensure value stays within rural economies.

**Challenges**: Requires interagency coordination and oversight.

**Refinements**: Include incentives for climate smart packaging and energy efficiency.

## State Model Legislation

### Rural Infrastructure and Soil Health Act

**Purpose**: Pair state water, energy, and broadband investments with local soil health plans.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SOIL HEALTH PLANS.
Local soil health partnership grants shall require measurable targets for cover crops, reduced tillage, and nutrient management.

SECTION 2. INFRASTRUCTURE ALIGNMENT.
State broadband and transportation programs shall prioritize agricultural corridors connected to resilient processing hubs.
```

**Explanation**: Connects infrastructure dollars to agricultural outcomes.

**Adaptations**: States can align with USDA resilience grants and conservation compliance.

## Regulatory Framework

### USDA Climate-Smart Conservation Rule

**Existing Authority**: Sections 1241 and 1242 of the Food Security Act of 1985.

**Draft Regulation**: Require conservation planners to include climate metrics in EQIP and CSP contracts, and condition crop insurance premium subsidies on demonstrated stewardship.

**Explanation**: Uses existing programs to shift incentives without new legislation.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

Spending Clause conditions are permissible when clearly stated and related to federal objectives. Labor protections tied to federal support are standard practice.

### Preemption Questions

Federal standards should create minimum guardrails while allowing states to exceed them in areas such as wage floors or conservation targets.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

Civil penalties, withholding of payments, and citizen suits can ensure compliance with housing, wage, and conservation requirements.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

Require GAO or USDA inspector-general reviews every five years to assess outcomes and ensure funds reach intended recipients.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Program gaming | Firms might shift payments to affiliate entities to avoid caps. | High |
| Labor misclassification | Contractors could be misclassified to skirt wage rules. | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Data gaps | Hard to measure soil health consistently | Fragmented reporting systems |
| Rural finance deserts | Small farms still face credit constraints | Risk models tied exclusively to land value |

### Rectification Procedures

1. Mandate transparent ownership and fund_flow audits to detect affiliates.
2. Require real-time reporting to shared data platforms and cross-agency compliance reviews.

### General Implementation Concerns

Oversight must balance fraud prevention with ease of participation; public-private partnerships can help finance measurement technology.
