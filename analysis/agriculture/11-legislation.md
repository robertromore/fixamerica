# Agriculture Policy: Legislation

## Overview

This section outlines the legislative framework required to transform U.S. agriculture into a resilient, equitable, and sustainable system. The current policy landscape, dominated by the quinquennial "Farm Bill," has successfully maximized commodity production but often at the expense of environmental health, market competition, and rural vitality. The proposed framework moves beyond the status quo of yield-based subsidies toward a comprehensive package that integrates food security, climate resilience, labor rights, and market fairness.

The legislative strategy rests on four pillars: (1) **Resilience and Supply Chains**, decentralizing processing and strengthening regional food systems; (2) **Workforce and Land Access**, stabilizing the labor force with legal status and protections while opening doors for new farmers; (3) **Climate and Conservation**, shifting funding from passive subsidies to active, outcome-based stewardship; and (4) **Competition**, restoring fair markets through antitrust enforcement. While the Farm Bill remains the primary vehicle for authorization, supplemental legislation is necessary to address labor (Judiciary/Education committees) and antitrust (Judiciary).

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for agriculture policy reform. Congress has ample authority under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) to fund conservation, nutrition, and farm support programs, and under the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) to regulate agricultural markets, food safety, and labor standards.*

## Federal Legislation

### The Resilient Food Systems Act

**Purpose**: To decentralize the U.S. food supply chain, invest in regional processing and distribution infrastructure, and ensure nutrition security through local procurement.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Regional Infrastructure Grants**: Authorizes $10 billion for meat processing, grain milling, and cold storage facilities to create alternatives to concentrated packers.
2. **Local Procurement Mandates**: Requires federal institutions (military, prisons) to source 30% of food regionally.
3. **Supply Chain Resilience Fund**: Creates a revolving fund to support businesses during supply chain disruptions.
4. **Food Hub Development**: Expands support for aggregation centers that connect small farmers to wholesale markets.
5. **Nutrition Security Integration**: Links SNAP and school meals to local food systems through enhanced reimbursement for local purchases.

This Act may be cited as the "Resilient Food Systems Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical vulnerabilities in the United States food supply chain, where the closure of a few large meatpacking plants led to simultaneous shortages for consumers and euthanasia of livestock by farmers.
(2) Four corporations control approximately 85 percent of beef processing, 70 percent of pork processing, and 54 percent of poultry processing (USDA AMS).
(3) Regional food systems generate greater local economic multipliers than consolidated national supply chains.
(4) Federal procurement spending exceeds $8 billion annually for food, representing a significant lever to support resilient regional markets.
(5) Infrastructure for local food aggregation, processing, and distribution has eroded over the last 40 years due to consolidation.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) SECRETARY.—The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Agriculture.

(b) DEFINITION.—For purposes of this section, "local or regional" means produced within the State or within 400 miles of the delivery destination.
(c) WAIVER.—The head of an agency may waive this requirement if sufficient local supply is not available at a reasonable price.

SEC. 6. SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE FUND.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established in the Treasury a revolving fund to be known as the "Supply Chain Resilience Fund".
(b) PURPOSE.—The Fund shall provide low-interest loans and loan guarantees to food system businesses to maintain operations during declared emergencies or supply chain disruptions.
(c) CAPITALIZATION.—There is appropriated $1,000,000,000 to the Fund, to remain available until expended.

SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Updates the "social contract" of farm subsidies—taxpayers subsidize risk, so farmers must mitigate it through stewardship.
- **Section 5**: Addresses the "missing middle" of the food supply chain, reducing reliance on a few mega-facilities.
- **Section 6**: Shifts conservation from paying for *practices* (which may fail) to paying for *results* (which deliver public value).

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Publish Soil Health Plan standards | 1 year after enactment | USDA NRCS |
| Accredit third-party verifiers | 18 months after enactment | USDA AMS |

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To mobilize the agricultural sector to combat climate change and restore ecosystems.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Climate Stewardship and Conservation Reform Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Agriculture contributes approximately 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (EPA).
(2) Nature-based climate solutions on agricultural land could sequester over 100 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent annually.
(3) The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) staffing levels have declined by 20 percent since 2004, limiting technical assistance.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) CLIMATE-SMART PRACTICE.—The term "climate-smart practice" means a practice that reduces greenhouse gas emissions or sequesters carbon, as determined by the Secretary.
(2) AGROFORESTRY.—The term "agroforestry" means the intentional integration of trees and shrubs into crop and animal farming systems.

SEC. 4. EQIP CLIMATE TARGETING.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 1240B of the Food Security Act of 1985 is amended by requiring that not less than 50 percent of funds be used for climate-smart practices.
(b) REMOVAL OF CAFO BIAS.—The requirement that 50 percent of EQIP funds be used for livestock operations is repealed.

SEC. 5. CONSERVATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Agriculture Resilience and Equity Act

**Purpose**: To complement federal programs by establishing state-level soil health goals, protecting farmland from development, and supporting local food systems.

**Adaptability Notes**: States with high development pressure should emphasize the easement provisions. States with water quality issues should emphasize the soil health targets.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Agriculture Resilience and Equity Act".

SECTION 2. SOIL HEALTH PROGRAM.
(a) GOAL.—It is the goal of the State to increase soil organic matter on agricultural lands by 1 percent over 10 years.
(b) GRANTS.—The Department of Agriculture shall award grants for equipment (e.g., no-till drills) and cover crop seeds.

SECTION 3. FARMLAND PROTECTION.
(a) EASEMENTS.—There is established a Farmland Preservation Fund to purchase development rights on prime agricultural land.
(b) PRIORITY.—Priority is given to farms selling to beginning or socially disadvantaged farmers.

SECTION 4. LOCAL PROCUREMENT.
(a) TARGET.—State institutions (schools, hospitals, prisons) shall source 20 percent of their food from within the State by 2030.
(b) PREFERENCE.—A 10 percent price preference is authorized for local bids.

SECTION 5. APPROPRIATION.
There is appropriated $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 to carry out this Act.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 2**: Sets a clear, measurable environmental target for the state's agriculture sector.
- **Section 3**: Uses state funds to prevent urban sprawl from consuming productive farmland.
- **Section 4**: Uses the state's purchasing power to create a reliable market for local farmers.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: USDA (NRCS, FSA, RMA, AMS).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Packers and Stockyards Act Rules**: Strengthen enforcement against unfair practices by meatpackers (USDA AMS). Deadline: 1 year.
2. **Climate-Smart Commodity Standards**: Define verification standards for "climate-smart" claims to prevent greenwashing.
3. **H-2A Modernization**: Revise guest worker rules to improve portability and worker protections (DOL/DHS).

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: Fines for crop insurance fraud or conservation non-compliance.
- **Administrative Actions**: Debarment from federal programs for labor violations.
- **Private Right of Action**: Allow farmers to sue integrators for contract violations.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause**: Conditions on crop insurance (conservation compliance) are constitutional under *South Dakota v. Dole* as they are germane to the federal interest in reducing risk.
**Takings Clause**: Regulatory changes to water rights or land use must avoid constituting a regulatory taking, though standard conservation requirements generally do not cross this line.

### Preemption

Federal labeling laws (e.g., GMO labeling) often preempt state laws. This legislation should include savings clauses to allow states to enact stricter labor or environmental standards than the federal floor.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance relies heavily on USDA's county office network. Modernizing IT systems for satellite verification of cover crops can reduce enforcement costs and improve accuracy.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **"Actively Engaged" Rule** | Investors claim management roles to collect subsidies without farming. | High | Tighten definition of "active personal management" to require physical presence. |
| **AGI Waivers** | Wealthy farms bypass income caps for subsidies. | Medium | Eliminate Secretary's authority to waive Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) limits. |
| **Contractor Loopholes** | Employers use labor contractors to avoid liability for worker violations. | High | Create "joint employer" liability for growers and labor contractors. |
| **Greenwashing** | Farms adopt one practice (e.g., no-till) but increase herbicide use, claiming "climate smart." | Medium | Require holistic conservation plans, not just single practices. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Data Privacy** | Farmers reluctant to share soil data. | Fear of regulation. | Statutorily protect individual data from FOIA; aggregate reporting only. |
| **Land Prices** | Subsidies capitalize into land values, hurting new farmers. | Subsidy structure. | Cap total subsidy payments per entity; link support to stewardship not yield. |
| **Labor Supply** | Legalization may lead some workers to leave ag. | Grueling work conditions. | Improve mechanization and working conditions to retain workforce. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Payment Caps**: Strictly enforce a $125,000 payment cap per natural person, with no spousal doubling unless both actively farm.
2. **Joint Liability**: Amend the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA) to ensure growers cannot outsource liability.
3. **Data Firewall**: Establish a "conservation data firewall" ensuring data collected for technical assistance cannot be used for regulatory enforcement actions by EPA.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **Farm Bill**: Reauthorization every 5 years.
- **Resilience Assessment**: Mandated every 5 years to adjust program parameters based on climate data.
