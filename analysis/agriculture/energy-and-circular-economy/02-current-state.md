# Energy & Circular Economy: Current State

## Overview

American agriculture stands at a transition point between its historical role as a net energy consumer and its potential as a distributed energy producer with closed-loop resource systems. While on-farm renewable energy deployment is accelerating—driven by declining solar costs, expanded REAP funding, and IRA incentives—most farms remain dependent on grid electricity and fossil fuels for operations. Similarly, circular economy practices like anaerobic digestion and nutrient recovery exist primarily at larger operations, leaving vast potential untapped at small and mid-size farms.
