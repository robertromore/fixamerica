# Energy & Circular Economy: History

## Overview

The history of energy in American agriculture tracks from animal and human power through fossil fuel dependence to emerging renewable alternatives. Circular economy concepts—closing nutrient and material loops—have ancient roots but only recently gained policy attention. Understanding this evolution reveals both opportunities and persistent barriers.

## Pre-Industrial Agriculture (Before 1900)

### Energy Sources

**Traditional Power**

| Source | Application | Limitation |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Human labor | All tasks | Physical constraints |
| Draft animals | Plowing, transport | Feed requirements |
| Water mills | Grinding, processing | Location dependent |
| Wind mills | Pumping, grinding | Intermittent |

**Circular Systems by Default**

- Manure returned to fields
- Crop rotation maintained fertility
- Waste minimal, reused
- Local processing common

### Early Mechanization

**Steam Power**

- Steam engines for threshing, pumping
- Stationary applications, not field work
- Fuel (wood, coal) required transport
- Limited adoption by small farms

---

## Fossil Fuel Transition (1900-1970)

### Mechanization Revolution

**The Tractor Era**

| Period | Development | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1910s | Gasoline tractors commercialized | Replaced draft animals |
| 1920s-30s | Tractor adoption accelerated | Labor displacement |
| 1940s-50s | Diesel tractors dominant | Higher efficiency |
| 1960s | Full mechanization | Energy-intensive farming |

**Energy Consumption Surge**

- Diesel for field operations
- Electricity for irrigation, milking, cooling
- Natural gas for drying, heating
- Petroleum-based inputs (fertilizers, chemicals)

### Rural Electrification

**The REA Revolution**

| Year | Development | Significance |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 1936 | Rural Electrification Administration created | Federal commitment |
| 1939 | 25% farm electrification | Rapid progress |
| 1950 | 78% farm electrification | Near-universal access |
| 1960s | 98%+ electrification | Full coverage |

**Transformation Effects**

- Electric motors replaced stationary engines
- Refrigeration enabled dairy, produce expansion
- Irrigation expanded in arid regions
- Farm life quality improved dramatically

### Linear Economy Dominance

**Break from Circular Systems**

- Synthetic fertilizers replaced manure
- Feed imported rather than grown on-farm
- Manure became waste problem, not resource
- Crop residues burned rather than incorporated
- Specialization broke nutrient cycles

## Energy Crisis Era (1970s-1980s)

### Oil Shocks and Agriculture

**1973 and 1979 Crises**

| Impact | Effect on Agriculture |
|--------|-----------------------|

- Energy conservation programs developed
- Alternative fuels research funded
- Solar and wind demonstration projects

### Early Renewable Interest

**Technologies Explored**

| Technology | Application | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Solar water heating | Dairy, greenhouse | Limited adoption |
| Wind pumping | Irrigation | Some adoption |
| Biomass heating | Grain drying | Research stage |
| Alcohol fuels | Tractor fuel | Experimental |

**Why Progress Stalled**

- Oil prices stabilized (1980s)
- Technology costs remained high
- Infrastructure investment prioritized elsewhere
- Policy attention shifted to other issues

## Ethanol and Biofuels Era (1990s-2010s)

### Corn Ethanol Expansion

**Policy Drivers**

| Year | Development | Effect |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1990 | Clean Air Act amendments | Oxygenate requirements |
| 2005 | Energy Policy Act | Renewable Fuel Standard |
| 2007 | Energy Independence and Security Act | Expanded mandates |
| 2007-08 | Record corn prices | Ethanol demand surge |

**Scale of Production**

- 2000: ~1.6 billion gallons/year
- 2010: ~13 billion gallons/year
- 2020: ~15 billion gallons/year (pre-COVID)
- 40%+ of corn crop to ethanol

**Circular Economy Dimensions**

- Distillers grains returned to livestock feed
- CO2 captured for industrial use (some facilities)
- But: Corn production highly input-intensive
- Net environmental benefit debated

### Anaerobic Digesters

**Technology Development**

| Era | Focus | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| 1970s | Early farm digesters | Technical challenges |
| 1990s | EPA AgSTAR program | Technical assistance |
| 2000s | Dairy digesters | Moderate adoption |
| 2010s | Co-digestion models | Emerging |

**Barriers to Adoption**

- High capital costs ($1-5M+)
- Technical complexity
- Variable gas quality
- Uncertain energy markets
- Permitting challenges

## Renewable Agriculture Era (2010s-Present)

### Solar Expansion

**Cost Revolution**

| Year | Solar PV Cost ($/watt) | Farm Viability |
|------|------------------------|----------------|
| 2010 | ~$7.00 | Uneconomic |
| 2015 | ~$3.00 | Large farms only |
| 2020 | ~$1.00 | Broadly viable |

**Farm Applications**

- Rooftop installations on barns, sheds
- Ground-mounted arrays on marginal land
- Agrivoltaics: solar + crop/grazing combination
- Solar pumping for irrigation

## Lessons from History

### What Has Worked

1. **Rural electrification model**: Federal commitment, cooperative structure, universal access
2. **Cost reductions through scale**: Solar, wind costs fell with deployment
3. **Technical assistance**: AgSTAR, REAP improved project success
4. **Policy certainty**: Long-term mandates enabled investment

### What Has Not Worked

1. **Technology-forcing without support**: Early digesters failed without technical help
2. **Subsidies without markets**: Biofuels without demand guarantees struggled
3. **Linear thinking in circular systems**: Treating waste as problem, not resource
4. **Ignoring transaction costs**: Small project economics challenging

### Recurring Patterns

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Crisis → innovation interest | 1970s oil shocks, climate concern |
| Cost curves drive adoption | Solar, storage following predictable declines |
| Infrastructure determines options | Grid capacity limits renewable deployment |
| Policy creates markets | RFS for ethanol, RECs for renewables |
