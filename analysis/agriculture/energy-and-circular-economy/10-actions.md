## For Agricultural Producers

### Getting Started with Energy Projects

**Step 1: Assess Your Energy Use**

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Review utility bills | Track 12+ months of electricity, fuel costs |
| Identify major loads | Irrigation, cooling, heating, drying |
| Calculate cost trends | Are costs rising? Seasonal patterns? |
| Request energy audit | Many utilities offer free assessments |

**Step 2: Explore Options**

| Technology | Best For | Typical ROI |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Solar PV | High electricity users | 5-8 years |
| Energy efficiency | All operations | 2-5 years |
| Solar pumping | Irrigated farms | 3-7 years |
| Digesters | Large livestock with waste management needs | 7-15 years |

**Step 3: Evaluate Financing**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| REAP grant | Up to 50% cost covered | Competitive, application burden |
| Tax credits (ITC) | 30-50% credit | Requires tax liability |
| Direct pay (IRA) | No tax liability needed | Administrative complexity |
| Utility programs | Simple process | Often smaller amounts |
| Equipment loans | Familiar to lenders | May not include energy |

### Applying for REAP

**Application Timeline**

| Phase | Timing | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Planning | 6-12 months before | Energy audit, project design |
