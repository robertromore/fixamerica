# Energy & Circular Economy: Overview

## Executive Summary

Energy and circular economy in agriculture encompasses the transformation of farms from net energy consumers into distributed energy producers while closing resource loops that currently waste nutrients, water, and organic materials. American agriculture consumes roughly 1% of total U.S. energy and contributes 10% of greenhouse gas emissions, yet farms possess enormous untapped potential for renewable energy generation, methane capture, and nutrient recovery that could simultaneously reduce costs, build rural resilience, and address climate goals.

The transition to energy-positive, circular agricultural systems requires coordinated investment in on-farm renewables (solar, wind, biogas), grid modernization for two-way power flows, waste-to-energy infrastructure, and precision nutrient management. Current programs like USDA's Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) and EPA's AgSTAR provide foundation, but scaling requires streamlined interconnection, expanded financing, workforce development, and integration of circular economy metrics into conservation programs.
