# Energy & Circular Economy: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Transforming American agriculture into an energy-producing, circular economy sector requires a phased approach that builds on existing programs, demonstrates success through pilots, and codifies reforms in legislation. This roadmap sequences administrative actions, appropriations requests, farm bill provisions, and energy legislation to create momentum for systemic change while navigating the political landscape across agricultural, energy, and environmental policy domains.

## Strategic Approach

### Core Strategy

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Build on existing programs** | Expand REAP, AgSTAR, and conservation programs before creating new ones |
| **Pilot then scale** | Test new models before national rollout |
| **Cooperative-first** | Work through rural electric cooperatives for grid and aggregation |
| **Integrate with conservation** | Embed energy in conservation planning and programs |
| **Cross-agency coordination** | Align USDA, DOE, and EPA programs |
| **State flexibility** | Design federal programs to complement state initiatives |
| **Evidence building** | Document outcomes to justify expansion |

### Political Landscape
