# Energy & Circular Economy: Stakeholders

## Overview

Agricultural energy and circular economy involve a complex ecosystem of farmers, utilities, technology providers, government agencies, and advocacy groups. Understanding who is affected, who holds power, and how interests align and conflict reveals opportunities for coalition building and barriers to progress.
