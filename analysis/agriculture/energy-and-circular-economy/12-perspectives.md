## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Resilience-First Storage Deals

- **Bridges**: Conservative, Centrist, Liberal
- **Core agreement**: Storage investments that provide grid services and local backup power.
- **Policy**: Grants tied to interconnection upgrades, demand response contracts, and local resilience metrics.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept phased reporting; conservatives accept limited mandates.
- **Viability**: High; aligns with reliability goals.

### Compromise 2: Circular Hubs with Market Offtake

- **Bridges**: Progressive, Centrist, Populist
- **Core agreement**: Circular nutrient systems with clear markets for recovered products.
- **Policy**: Offtake agreements required for grants, with transparent verification standards.
- **Concessions**: Industry accepts reporting; reformers accept market-led participation.
- **Viability**: Medium-high; depends on stable buyers.

### Compromise 3: Workforce and TA Compact

- **Bridges**: Religious Right, Conservative, Liberal
- **Core agreement**: Local training and technician pipelines to keep jobs rural.
- **Policy**: Regional hubs with community college partnerships and small-farm TA set-asides.
- **Concessions**: Federal oversight limited to performance metrics.
- **Viability**: High; broad support for workforce capacity.

## Strategic Implications

- Most viable coalition centers on workforce hubs and resilience-focused storage.
- Key obstacle is distrust of data mandates and subsidy design.
- Bad-faith risk appears limited; focus on pilot projects with transparent outcomes.
- Recommended approach: pass Workforce & Finance Hub first, then scale Renewable & Storage and Circular Hubs with phased verification.
