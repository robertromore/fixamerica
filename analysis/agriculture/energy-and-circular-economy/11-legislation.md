# Energy and Circular Economy: Legislation

## Overview

Energy and circular economy legislation aims to transform American farms from net energy consumers and waste generators into distributed energy producers and resource recyclers. Current federal programs like the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) and EPA's AgSTAR provide a foundation, but they are underfunded relative to the opportunity and poorly integrated with conservation and climate programs. The legislative approach here is incremental, building on existing USDA and DOE authorities while creating new performance-based incentives that reward measurable outcomes -- emissions reductions, energy production, and nutrient recovery -- rather than simply subsidizing installations.

The strategy rests on three pillars: deploying renewable energy and storage on farms, scaling circular systems (digesters, composting, nutrient recovery) that close resource loops, and building the workforce and financing infrastructure to sustain the transition. Federal legislation sets outcome standards and provides capital; state model legislation fills gaps in permitting and utility coordination; and administrative rulemaking aligns existing programs with circular economy metrics.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for agricultural energy and circular economy reform. Congress has ample authority under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) to fund energy transition programs, under the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) to regulate interstate energy markets and environmental externalities, and under the Tax Clause to provide incentives for renewable energy adoption.*

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Addresses the chronic oversubscription of REAP by doubling funding and reserving a substantial share for small farms that currently struggle to compete with larger applicants.
- **Section 5**: Recognizes that generation alone is insufficient -- storage and microgrids convert intermittent renewable energy into reliable, grid-resilient power, which is critical for cold storage and processing operations.
- **Section 6**: Removes the interconnection bottleneck that can delay farm-scale solar projects by 12-36 months, killing economics.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Publish expanded REAP NOFA | FY 2027 | USDA Rural Development |
| FERC interconnection rulemaking | 1 year after enactment | FERC |
| First microgrid grants awarded | FY 2027 | USDA Rural Development |
| Agrivoltaics research awards | FY 2027 | USDA NIFA / DOE |

**Challenges**:

- **Utility Resistance**: Rural electric cooperatives may resist interconnection reforms that reduce their control over generation and distribution.
- **Grid Capacity**: Some rural feeders are at capacity and cannot absorb new generation without substation upgrades.

**Refinements**:

- Include a companion grant for cooperative grid upgrades triggered by farm-scale generation projects.
- Allow stacking of storage incentives with IRA tax credits, with clear anti-double-counting rules.

### The Circular Nutrient and Bioenergy Infrastructure Act

**Purpose**: To scale anaerobic digestion, composting, pyrolysis, and nutrient recovery infrastructure by providing performance-based payments tied to verified environmental outcomes, not just facility construction.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Performance-Based Payments**: Authorizes bonus payments conditioned on verified reductions in methane emissions, nutrient runoff, and increases in recovered energy output.
2. **Regional Digester Hub Program**: Funds shared anaerobic digestion facilities that aggregate waste from multiple farms, achieving economies of scale that individual farms cannot.
3. **Nutrient Recovery Grants**: Supports infrastructure for phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium recovery from waste streams to produce marketable fertilizer products.
4. **Offtake Guarantee Program**: Provides loan guarantees for facilities with long-term offtake agreements for biogas, renewable natural gas, or recovered nutrients.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To expand circular nutrient and bioenergy infrastructure in United States agriculture, linking financial support to measurable environmental outcomes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Circular Nutrient and Bioenergy Infrastructure Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) United States livestock operations produce over 1 billion tons of manure annually, the majority of which is stored or applied without energy or nutrient recovery (EPA, 2024).
(2) The Environmental Protection Agency has identified over 8,500 candidate farms for anaerobic digester installation, yet only approximately 300 systems are operational nationally (EPA AgSTAR, 2024).
(3) Agricultural nutrient loss -- nitrogen and phosphorus runoff -- costs the economy an estimated $15 billion annually in lost fertilizer value and downstream environmental damage (USDA, 2023).
(4) Methane from livestock manure is 80 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period, making capture and destruction a high-impact climate intervention (IPCC, 2021).
(5) Circular agriculture systems that recover energy and nutrients from waste streams can reduce input costs by 20-30 percent while generating new revenue (DOE Bioenergy Technologies Office, 2023).

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) ANAEROBIC DIGESTER.—The term "anaerobic digester" means a system that decomposes organic material in the absence of oxygen to produce biogas and digestate.
(2) CIRCULAR AGRICULTURE FACILITY.—The term "circular agriculture facility" means any facility that recovers energy, nutrients, or usable materials from agricultural waste streams.
(3) NUTRIENT RECOVERY.—The term "nutrient recovery" means the extraction of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, or other plant nutrients from waste streams for reuse as fertilizer or soil amendment.
(4) SECRETARY.—The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Agriculture.

SEC. 4. PERFORMANCE-BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary shall establish a program of annual payments to operators of circular agriculture facilities based on verified environmental outcomes.
(b) ELIGIBLE OUTCOMES.—Payments shall be based on—
    (1) metric tons of methane captured or destroyed;
    (2) pounds of nitrogen and phosphorus recovered from waste streams; and
    (3) kilowatt-hours of renewable energy generated from agricultural waste.
(c) VERIFICATION.—Outcomes must be verified by independent third-party auditors using protocols established by the Secretary.

SEC. 5. REGIONAL DIGESTER HUB PROGRAM.

(a) GRANTS.—The Secretary shall award grants for the construction of regional anaerobic digester hubs that accept waste from 5 or more farm operations.
(b) PRIORITY.—Priority shall be given to proposals in watersheds with documented nutrient impairment.
(c) COOPERATIVE OWNERSHIP.—Not less than 30 percent of grant funds shall be reserved for facilities with cooperative or producer-owned governance structures.
(d) COST SHARE.—The Federal share shall not exceed 65 percent of eligible project costs.

SEC. 6. NUTRIENT RECOVERY AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT.

(a) INFRASTRUCTURE.—The Secretary shall provide grants for nutrient recovery equipment, including struvite precipitation, ammonia stripping, and composting systems.
(b) QUALITY STANDARDS.—The Secretary shall establish quality and safety standards for recovered nutrient products to facilitate market acceptance.
(c) PROCUREMENT.—Federal agencies procuring fertilizer shall give preference to products containing recovered nutrients, consistent with cost and quality requirements.

SEC. 7. OFFTAKE GUARANTEE PROGRAM.

(a) LOAN GUARANTEES.—The Secretary shall provide loan guarantees for circular agriculture facilities that have executed long-term offtake agreements for biogas, renewable natural gas, or recovered nutrients.
(b) TERMS.—Loan guarantees shall cover up to 80 percent of the outstanding principal.

SEC. 8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

The Secretary shall report annually to Congress on:
(1) The volume of methane captured and energy generated by funded facilities.
(2) Pounds of nutrients recovered and marketed.
(3) Cost per ton of methane abated compared to other climate interventions.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $450,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $550,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $600,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Shifts the incentive structure from "build it and get paid" to "prove it works and get paid," preventing waste on facilities that underperform or are abandoned.
- **Section 5**: Addresses the fundamental economics problem -- individual farm digesters often fail economically, but regional hubs processing waste from multiple farms can achieve viable scale.
- **Section 6**: Closes the loop by creating markets for recovered nutrients, so that the output of circular systems has commercial value rather than remaining a disposal problem.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Publish performance payment protocols | 1 year after enactment | USDA NRCS |
| Issue regional hub grant NOFA | FY 2027 | USDA Rural Development |
| Establish nutrient quality standards | 18 months after enactment | USDA / EPA |
| First offtake loan guarantees | FY 2028 | USDA Rural Development |

**Challenges**:

- **Verification Costs**: Third-party verification of methane capture and nutrient recovery adds expense, particularly for smaller facilities.
- **Credit Double-Counting**: Facilities may attempt to claim both federal performance payments and voluntary carbon market credits for the same emissions reduction.

**Refinements**:

- Establish a "stacking registry" that tracks which incentives a facility receives and prevents double-counting.
- Fund mobile verification teams to reduce per-facility audit costs.

### The Rural Energy Workforce and Finance Hub Act

**Purpose**: To create a national network of regional hubs that coordinate apprenticeship programs, technical assistance, and blended financing for agricultural energy and circular economy projects, ensuring that workforce capacity keeps pace with deployment.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Regional Hub Network**: Establishes 10 regional hubs pairing DOE, USDA, community colleges, and lenders.
2. **Apprenticeship and Certification**: Creates industry-recognized credentials for agricultural energy technicians covering solar installation, digester operation, and microgrid maintenance.
3. **Loan Loss Reserves**: Authorizes hubs to provide loan loss reserves for community development financial institutions (CDFIs) and lenders financing projects on small and underserved operations.
4. **Project Development Support**: Funds pre-development assistance (energy audits, feasibility studies, permitting) to move projects from concept to construction.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To establish a network of regional hubs that build workforce capacity, coordinate financing, and provide technical assistance for agricultural energy and circular economy projects.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Rural Energy Workforce and Finance Hub Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Rural installer and technician shortages are the most frequently cited barrier to agricultural energy project deployment in cooperative and USDA program surveys (NRECA, 2024).
(2) Small and underserved farm operations face disproportionate difficulty accessing financing for energy projects, with rejection rates 40 percent higher than for large operations (USDA Farm Service Agency data, 2023).
(3) Pre-development costs -- energy audits, feasibility studies, permitting -- consume 5-15 percent of project budgets, deterring projects that lack upfront capital (DOE, 2023).
(4) Existing federal workforce programs are siloed across DOE, DOL, and USDA, creating gaps in training for rural-specific energy occupations.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) HUB.—The term "hub" means a regional center established under Section 4 that coordinates workforce development, financing, and technical assistance for agricultural energy and circular economy projects.
(2) ELIGIBLE INSTITUTION.—The term "eligible institution" means a community college, technical institute, land-grant university, or non-profit organization with demonstrated capacity in energy or agricultural workforce training.
(3) ENERGY TECHNICIAN.—The term "energy technician" means a person trained and certified to install, operate, or maintain renewable energy, energy storage, or circular agriculture systems.
(4) SECRETARY.—The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Agriculture.

SEC. 4. REGIONAL HUB NETWORK.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Labor, shall establish not fewer than 10 regional hubs.
(b) FUNCTIONS.—Each hub shall—
    (1) coordinate apprenticeship and certification programs;
    (2) provide project development technical assistance;
    (3) administer loan loss reserves for participating lenders; and
    (4) maintain a database of certified technicians, available financing, and completed projects.
(c) GOVERNANCE.—Each hub shall be governed by a board including farmers, cooperatives, lenders, educational institutions, and state energy officials.

SEC. 5. APPRENTICESHIP AND CERTIFICATION.

(a) PROGRAM.—Each hub shall administer registered apprenticeship programs for agricultural energy technicians.
(b) CREDENTIALS.—The Secretary, in consultation with DOL, shall establish portable, nationally recognized credentials for agricultural energy installation, digester operation, and microgrid maintenance.
(c) STIPENDS.—Apprentices shall receive a stipend of not less than $15 per hour during training.

SEC. 6. LOAN LOSS RESERVES.

(a) AUTHORIZATION.—The Secretary shall capitalize loan loss reserves at each hub to incentivize lending to small and underserved operations.
(b) COVERAGE.—Reserves shall cover up to 20 percent of losses on qualifying agricultural energy loans.
(c) ELIGIBLE LENDERS.—CDFIs, cooperative lenders, and Farm Credit System institutions are eligible to participate.

SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

Each hub shall report annually to the Secretary on:
(1) The number of technicians trained and certified.
(2) Projects assisted from feasibility through construction.
(3) Loan loss reserve utilization and default rates.

SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $175,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $225,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $250,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Solves the coordination failure where farmers, lenders, and installers operate in separate silos. Hubs act as one-stop shops that de-risk the entire project pipeline.
- **Section 5**: Addresses the single biggest bottleneck -- there are not enough trained technicians in rural areas to install and maintain the systems that farmers want.
- **Section 6**: Reduces lender risk for loans to small operations, which are perceived as higher risk not because they default more but because they lack the collateral and documentation that streamline underwriting.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Issue hub solicitation | 180 days after enactment | USDA / DOE |
| Select hub locations | 1 year after enactment | USDA / DOE |
| First apprentices enrolled | FY 2028 | Hubs / Community Colleges |
| Loan loss reserves capitalized | FY 2027 | USDA Rural Development |

**Challenges**:

- **Multi-Agency Coordination**: USDA, DOE, and DOL must align programs, which historically has proven difficult.
- **Sustained Funding**: Hubs require multi-year commitments to build institutional capacity; annual appropriations uncertainty undermines this.

**Refinements**:

- Designate a single lead agency (USDA) with interagency MOUs to simplify governance.
- Authorize 5-year cooperative agreements rather than annual grants for hub funding stability.

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: USDA Rural Development (energy programs) and USDA NRCS (conservation integration).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **REAP Program Expansion**: Update REAP regulations to incorporate storage incentives, microgrid eligibility, and small-farm set-asides. Deadline: 1 year.
2. **Performance Payment Protocols**: USDA NRCS shall develop third-party verification protocols for methane capture, nutrient recovery, and renewable energy output. Deadline: 18 months.
3. **Conservation Practice Integration**: Update EQIP and CSP practice codes to include energy generation, digester operation, and nutrient recovery as eligible conservation practices. Deadline: 1 year.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: Clawback of grants and performance payments for facilities that misrepresent outcomes or abandon projects within 5 years.
- **Administrative Actions**: Debarment of contractors or facility operators who falsify verification data.
- **Private Right of Action**: Not applicable for program administration; disputes resolved through USDA administrative appeals.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

Congress has clear authority under the Spending Clause to condition agricultural program payments on energy and circular economy practices. The Commerce Clause supports regulation of energy markets and environmental externalities that cross state lines. No takings concerns arise because all programs are voluntary.

### Preemption

Federal energy and environmental standards set minimum floors. States retain authority over utility regulation, permitting, and supplemental incentive programs. Preemption clauses must explicitly preserve state public utility commission jurisdiction over interconnection rates and grid management.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance relies on third-party verification of performance outcomes, USDA spot audits, and financial reconciliation of grant disbursements. Remote sensing and automated metering can reduce verification costs for energy output.

---

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **Performance gaming** | Facilities overstate methane capture or energy output to claim higher payments | High | Require calibrated meters with tamper-proof data logging; random third-party audits |
| **Renewable double-dipping** | Projects claim both federal performance payments and IRA tax credits for the same emissions reduction | Medium | Establish a stacking registry and reduce performance payments proportionally for projects receiving tax credits |
| **Circular feedstock fraud** | Facilities import non-agricultural waste to inflate throughput metrics and claim agricultural benefits | Medium | Require chain-of-custody documentation for all feedstocks; limit eligible inputs to agricultural waste |
| **Sham cooperatives** | Large operators create shell cooperatives to access set-aside funds intended for independent producers | High | Define cooperative eligibility with minimum producer-member thresholds and independent governance requirements |
| **Interconnection stalling** | Utilities delay compliance with streamlined interconnection rules through procedural challenges | Medium | Impose statutory deadlines with automatic approval if missed; fund cooperative compliance assistance |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Access gaps for small farms** | Underserved operations cannot navigate application processes | Lack of regional outreach and technical assistance capacity | Fund hub-based project development support; simplify application forms |
| **Grid infrastructure limits** | Rural feeders at capacity block new distributed generation | Legacy infrastructure designed for one-way power flow | Pair generation incentives with cooperative grid upgrade grants |
| **Workforce shortage** | Certified technicians unavailable in many rural areas | Limited training programs; low wages relative to urban energy jobs | Apprenticeship stipends; certification portability; retention bonuses |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Stacking Registry**: Create a federal registry tracking all energy and circular economy incentives received by each facility to prevent double-counting across federal, state, and market-based programs.
2. **Tiered Verification**: Implement risk-based verification where small projects undergo simplified self-reporting while large facilities face full third-party audits, reducing costs without sacrificing integrity.
3. **Cooperative Integrity Standards**: Publish clear governance requirements for cooperative eligibility, including minimum member counts, democratic voting rules, and prohibition on single-entity control.
4. **Automatic Interconnection Approval**: Amend interconnection rules to provide that if a utility fails to act on a complete application within 90 days, the application is deemed approved.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **Performance Payment Protocols**: Review and update every 3 years as measurement technology improves.
- **Hub Network**: Reauthorize after 5 years based on GAO evaluation of workforce outcomes and project throughput.
- **REAP Expansion**: Align with Farm Bill reauthorization cycle.
