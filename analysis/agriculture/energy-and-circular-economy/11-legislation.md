# Energy & Circular Economy: Legislation

## Overview

This legislative package pairs clean energy deployment with circular nutrient/waste systems and workforce development, aiming to reduce emissions, cut energy costs, and make agriculture a net-positive resource steward.

## Model Federal Bills

### 1. Farm Energy Resilience & Innovation Act

**Purpose**: Fund renewables, storage, microgrids, and rural grid upgrades while requiring grid-service agreements for resilience value.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Farm Energy Resilience & Innovation Act."

SEC. 2. GRANTS AND LOANS.
The Secretary shall award grants and low-interest loans covering up to 60% of distributed generation + storage costs for projects that serve rural critical infrastructure during emergencies.

SEC. 3. GRID SERVICES.
Projects must enter contracts with utilities or co-ops to provide demand response or islanding capability.
```

**Explanation**: Incentivizes dual-use projects that lower costs and improve outage recovery.

**Challenges**: Aligning with state public utility commissions and securing co-op participation.

### 2. Circular Nutrient & Bioenergy Infrastructure Act

**Purpose**: Expand digesters, pyrolysis, composting, and nutrient recovery facilities with performance-based payments.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Circular Nutrient & Bioenergy Infrastructure Act."

SEC. 2. PERFORMANCE PAYMENTS.
Condition bonus payments on verified reductions in methane emissions, nutrient runoff, and increased bioenergy output.

SEC. 3. OFFTAKE GUARANTEES.
Create grant-LOAN packages for facilities with offtake agreements from processors, manufacturers, or carbon markets.
```

**Explanation**: Links payments to outcomes while ensuring market demand for recovered materials.

**Challenges**: Measuring results and preventing credit double-counting.

### 3. Rural Energy Workforce & Finance Hub Act

**Purpose**: Create a national hub that coordinates apprenticeships, technical assistance, and blended financing for energy/circular projects.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Rural Energy Workforce & Finance Hub Act."

SEC. 2. HUB NETWORK.
Establish regional centers that pair DOE, USDA, community colleges, and lenders to certify technicians, package financing, and support project planning.

SEC. 3. LOAN LOSS RESERVES.
Allow the hub to provide loan loss reserves for lenders financing small/underserved operations.
```

**Explanation**: Ensures workforce capacity and financing availability to sustain long-term deployment.

**Challenges**: Federal-state coordination and ongoing appropriations.

## State Model Legislation

States can adopt “State Clean Agriculture Energy Partnership Acts” that:

- Match federal grants for distributed generation and digesters.
- Offer tax abatements for circular nutrient facilities that report environmental outcomes.
- Establish state energy-circular task forces to streamline permitting and share best practices.

## Regulatory Framework

- USDA should update REAP, AgSTAR, and EQIP guidance to prioritize integrated energy-circular proposals.
- DOE and USDA must coordinate interconnection standards and grid-service compensation.
- EPA should align nutrient recovery reporting with Clean Water Act and greenhouse gas monitoring rules.

## Legal Considerations

- Constitutional Issues: Ensure appropriation language respects the Spending Clause while protecting producers from unreasonable search through data collection.
- Preemption: Federal standards set minimums while allowing states to exceed them; preemption clauses must preserve state utility commissions’ jurisdiction over rates.
- Enforcement: Penalties for misreporting outcomes, clawback provisions for improper usage of grants, and pathways for private citizens to report noncompliance.
- Sunset & Review: Mandate reviews every five years with stakeholder input, adjusting metrics as technology evolves.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Performance gaming | Projects overstate savings or emissions reductions | Medium |
| Renewable double-dipping | Claiming multiple incentives for the same capacity (e.g., ITC + farm grants) | Medium |
| Circular feedstock sourcing | Facilities use non-agricultural waste to claim agricultural benefits | Low |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Access gaps | Underserved farms lack TA to apply | Lack of regional outreach capacity |
| Grid barriers | Interconnection costs delay projects | Legacy utility rules |
| Workforce shortage | Projects stall without certified technicians | Limited training programs in rural areas |

### Rectification Procedures

1. Fund rigorous third-party validation and build data analytics to detect overstated claims.
2. Coordinate incentive programs (e.g., ITC, USDA grants) to avoid duplication while ensuring additive benefits.
3. Channel grants to training partnerships, community colleges, and apprenticeship programs to grow the technician pipeline.

### General Implementation Concerns

Ensure appropriation cycles align with multi-year projects; require auditors to confirm matched funding and tie future eligibility to compliance history.
