# Water & Climate Resilience: Current State

## Overview

The U.S. agricultural water system faces mounting stress from aging infrastructure, declining aquifers, intensifying droughts, and climate-driven disruptions. While irrigation enables consistent production across arid regions, the infrastructure is deteriorating, groundwater reserves are depleting faster than recharge in critical areas, and climate change is increasing both drought and flood risks. Federal programs through the Bureau of Reclamation, Army Corps of Engineers, and USDA provide support, but investment has not kept pace with needs. Governance remains fragmented across federal, state, and local jurisdictions, complicating coordinated responses to water scarcity and climate adaptation.
