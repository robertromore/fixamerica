## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Modernization with Verified Savings

- **Bridges**: Conservative, Centrist, Liberal
- **Core agreement**: Invest in upgrades that prove water savings.
- **Policy**: Grants tied to monitoring and maintenance plans.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept phased targets; skeptics accept funding.
- **Viability**: High; strong cross-party appeal.

### Compromise 2: Recharge First, Governance Later

- **Bridges**: Conservative, Centrist, Progressive
- **Core agreement**: Build drought reserves while reducing conflict.
- **Policy**: Prioritize recharge projects and delay governance mandates.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept sequencing; skeptics accept pilots.
- **Viability**: High; easier consensus.

### Compromise 3: Insurance Pilots with Opt-In Standards

- **Bridges**: Centrist, Conservative, Liberal
- **Core agreement**: Incentivize resilience without mandatory compliance.
- **Policy**: Optional insurance discounts with evaluation triggers.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept opt-in; skeptics accept limited incentives.
- **Viability**: Medium-high; depends on actuarial results.

## Strategic Implications

- Most viable coalition centers on modernization and recharge investments.
- Key obstacle is governance reform and insurance mandates.
- Bad-faith risk appears limited; focus on pilots and verified savings.
- Recommended approach: pass modernization and recharge acts first, then phase in governance and insurance reforms.
