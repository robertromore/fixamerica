# Water & Climate Resilience: Stakeholders

## Overview

Water and climate resilience policy involves a diverse ecosystem of stakeholders—from farmers who depend on reliable water supplies to irrigation districts that manage infrastructure, from state water agencies that allocate rights to federal agencies that fund projects, from environmental groups advocating for ecosystem flows to tribal nations asserting treaty rights. Understanding who is affected by water stress, who has power to shape policy, and where interests align or conflict is essential for designing reforms that can build lasting coalitions and address the interconnected challenges of water scarcity, infrastructure decay, and climate adaptation.
