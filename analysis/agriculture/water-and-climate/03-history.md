# Water & Climate Resilience: History

## Overview

The history of water management and climate adaptation in American agriculture traces from early irrigation development through massive federal infrastructure investments, environmental awakening, and recent confrontation with climate change. Understanding this evolution reveals how past choices shaped current vulnerabilities—and why resilience now requires different approaches than expansion.

## Lessons from History

### What Has Worked

1. **Federal infrastructure investment**: Created productive agricultural base
2. **Conservation programs**: EQIP, CSP support efficiency
3. **Environmental review**: NEPA prevented some bad projects
4. **Water markets**: Some successful transfers
5. **Basin coordination**: Compact and agreement frameworks

### What Has Not Worked

1. **Over-allocation**: More rights than water
2. **Groundwater neglect**: Mining aquifers
3. **Ignoring climate change**: Infrastructure built for old normal
4. **Short-term disaster response**: Not building resilience
5. **Fragmented governance**: Coordination gaps

### Unresolved Challenges

| Challenge | Current Status |
|-----------|----------------|
| Over-allocation | Colorado River, other basins |
| Groundwater depletion | Ogallala, Central Valley |
| Climate adaptation | Insufficient investment |
| Infrastructure aging | Deferred maintenance |
| Governance coordination | Fragmented authority |
