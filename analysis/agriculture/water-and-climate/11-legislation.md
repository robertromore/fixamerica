# Water and Climate: Legislation

## Overview

Agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater in the United States and the sector most vulnerable to the accelerating impacts of climate change. The legislative framework for water and climate aims to transition the sector from a reactive posture—relying on ad-hoc disaster relief and depleting aquifers—to a proactive system of resilience and adaptation.

This legislation focuses on three critical areas: (1) modernizing irrigation infrastructure and groundwater governance to address structural scarcity in the West; (2) reducing nutrient runoff and improving water quality in the Midwest and South; and (3) reforming federal crop insurance and disaster programs to incentivize climate resilience rather than risk-taking. The approach combines voluntary incentives with updated compliance standards, leveraging federal funding to drive systemic change while respecting state water law primacy.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for water and climate reform in agriculture. Congress has broad authority under the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) to regulate waters of the United States and environmental impacts affecting interstate commerce, and under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) to fund conservation and infrastructure programs.*

## Federal Legislation

### The Agricultural Water Sustainability and Aquifer Recovery Act

**Purpose**: To address the crisis of aquifer depletion and surface water scarcity by funding irrigation modernization, incentivizing voluntary water conservation, and establishing a national framework for groundwater recharge.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **WaterSMART Expansion**: Significantly expands the Bureau of Reclamation's WaterSMART program to fund large-scale irrigation efficiency and water recycling projects.
2. **Voluntary Fallowing Program**: Authorizes a permanent, federally funded program to pay farmers for temporary or permanent voluntary reduction of consumptive water use in critically overdrafted basins.
3. **Groundwater Recharge Infrastructure**: Establishes a grant program for on-farm groundwater recharge projects (e.g., flooding fields during high flow events).
4. **Measurement and Telemetry**: Mandates and funds the installation of real-time water measurement devices for all federally subsidized irrigation districts.
5. **Western Water Authority**: Creates a trans-boundary authority to coordinate federal response to the Colorado River and Ogallala Aquifer crises.

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Scales up proven efficiency programs to match the magnitude of the western water crisis.
- **Section 5**: Provides a "soft landing" for farmers in drying regions, paying them to reduce water use rather than forcing abrupt cutoffs.
- **Section 6**: Turns farms into sponges, using agricultural land to capture floodwaters and refill aquifers for future use.
- **Section 7**: Implements the "you can't manage what you don't measure" principle, essential for any market-based or regulatory water management.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Publish WaterSMART NOFA | 90 days after enactment | Bureau of Reclamation |
| Establish Fallowing Rates | 180 days after enactment | USDA/DOI |
| Telemetry Standards Issued | 1 year after enactment | Bureau of Reclamation |
| First Recharge Grants | FY 2027 | USDA NRCS |

**Challenges**:

- **State Law Conflicts**: "Use it or lose it" doctrines in Western water law discourage conservation; federal protections are necessary but legally complex.
- **Data Privacy**: Farmers are historically resistant to metering wells due to fear of regulation.

**Refinements**:

- Include specific legal safe harbors for water rights holders participating in federal conservation programs.
- Ensure data aggregation to protect individual producer privacy while allowing basin-level management.

### The Clean Water for Rural Communities and Agriculture Act

**Draft Text**:

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To modernize the Federal Crop Insurance Program to address climate change and promote resilient agriculture.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Climate-Resilient Crop Insurance Reform Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of agricultural disasters, threatening the solvency of the crop insurance system.
(2) Certain conservation practices, such as cover cropping, have been proven to reduce yield variability and prevent prevented planting claims.
(3) Current crop insurance rules often penalize producers for adopting diversified, resilient systems.
(4) Protecting native grasslands is one of the most cost-effective climate mitigation strategies available.

SEC. 3. RESILIENCE PREMIUM DISCOUNT.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508) is amended by adding a provision to offer a premium discount to producers who adopt climate-resilient practices.
(b) ELIGIBLE PRACTICES.—Practices shall include cover cropping, no-till, and resource-conserving crop rotations.
(c) AMOUNT.—The discount shall be actuarially sound but not less than $5 per acre.

SEC. 4. NATIONWIDE SODSAVER.

(a) AMENDMENT.—Section 508(o) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended by striking the geographic limitation, making the provision applicable to all counties in the United States.
(b) REDUCTION.—Subsidy rates for crops planted on native sod shall be reduced by 50 percentage points for the first 4 years of planting.

SEC. 5. WHOLE FARM REVENUE PROTECTION REFORM.

(a) STREAMLINING.—The Corporation shall simplify the application process for Whole Farm Revenue Protection to reduce paperwork burden by at least 50 percent.
(b) AGENT INCENTIVES.—The Corporation shall provide additional compensation to insurance agents for selling Whole Farm policies to reflect the additional complexity.

SEC. 6. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) CLIMATE RISK.—The Corporation shall submit an annual report to Congress analyzing the exposure of the insurance portfolio to climate-related risks.
(b) ADOPTION RATES.—The report shall include data on the adoption of resilience practices by insured producers.

SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $110,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $120,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $130,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $140,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3**: Aligns financial incentives with physical risk reduction; farmers who protect their soil are "good drivers" and should pay less for insurance.
- **Section 4**: Removes the perverse incentive to plow up native prairies (which store carbon and water) to plant subsidized crops.
- **Section 5**: Makes the best insurance product for diversified farms (WFRP) actually usable, supporting resilience through diversity.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Issue Discount Rules | 180 days after enactment | USDA RMA |
| Sodsaver Map Update | 1 year after enactment | USDA FSA/RMA |
| WFRP New Forms | 2027 Crop Year | USDA RMA |

**Challenges**:

- **Agent Resistance**: Crop insurance agents often resist WFRP because it is complex and pays lower commissions than single-crop policies.
- **Data Gaps**: Actuarial data linking specific practices to risk reduction is still being developed.

**Refinements**:

- Fund data mining of RMA records to definitively prove the risk-reduction benefits of soil health practices.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Water Resilience and Planning Act

**Purpose**: To mandate watershed-level planning, establish groundwater sustainability agencies, and authorize state funding for water conservation.

**Adaptability Notes**: Western states should focus on the groundwater management provisions (Section 3). Eastern states should focus on the watershed planning and flood resilience (Section 2).

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Water Resilience and Planning Act".

SECTION 2. WATERSHED RESILIENCE PLANNING.
(a) REQUIREMENT.—Each major watershed in the State shall develop a Watershed Resilience Plan to address drought, flooding, and water quality.
(b) COMPONENTS.—Plans must include water budgets, drought contingency triggers, and identified projects for natural infrastructure.

SECTION 3. GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY.
(a) DESIGNATION.—The Department of Natural Resources shall designate priority groundwater basins.
(b) AGENCIES.—Local Groundwater Sustainability Agencies shall be formed in priority basins to develop plans to achieve sustainable yield within 20 years.
(c) METERS.—All non-de minimis extractors must install water meters.

SECTION 4. WATER CONSERVATION FUND.
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established a Water Conservation Fund.
(b) USE.—Funds shall be used for irrigation efficiency, turf replacement, and watershed restoration.

SECTION 5. APPROPRIATION.
There is appropriated $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 to carry out this Act.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 2**: Moves water management from political boundaries to hydrological boundaries.
- **Section 3**: Adapts California's SGMA model to other states, requiring local control but state backstops for groundwater management.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: USDA (NRCS, RMA) and DOI (Bureau of Reclamation).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Crop Insurance Good Farming Practices**: Update handbook to explicitly protect conservation practices (cover crops) from being labeled "bad farming." Deadline: 1 year.
2. **Water Quality Trading**: Finalize rules for interstate water quality trading in the Mississippi River Basin.
3. **Efficiency Standards**: Update standards for irrigation equipment eligible for federal funding.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: Fines for tampering with water measurement devices.
- **Administrative Actions**: Loss of subsidy eligibility for Sodsaver violations.
- **Private Right of Action**: Generally not applicable, but citizen suits under Clean Water Act remain relevant for CAFOs.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Takings Clause**: Restrictions on water pumping (groundwater regulation) often trigger takings claims. Courts generally uphold reasonable regulation of shared resources, but "total deprivation" of water rights requires compensation. The legislation emphasizes voluntary, compensated reductions to avoid this.
**Interstate Compacts**: The Colorado River and other interstate waters are governed by compacts. Federal legislation must respect these but can condition funding on compact adherence or modernization.

### Preemption

Water rights are primarily state law. Federal legislation avoids preemption by using the "power of the purse" (conditioning funds) rather than direct regulation of water rights.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance relies on technological verification (telemetry, satellite data) rather than just self-reporting. This reduces enforcement costs and increases accuracy.

---

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **"Efficiency Paradox"** | Farmers use saved water to expand acreage or switch to thirstier crops, increasing total consumption. | High | Require that federally funded efficiency projects legally transfer "saved" water to the system/environment. |
| **Sodsaver Geography** | Developers target counties just outside the protected zone (if not national). | Medium | Make Sodsaver nationwide (as proposed). |
| **Base Acre Gaming** | Farmers plant crops just to build base acres for payments. | Medium | Freeze base acres to a historical period. |
| **Groundwater Transfer** | Pumping groundwater to replace surface water cuts. | High | Link surface and groundwater management in federal project areas. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Western Water Law** | "Use it or lose it" discourages conservation. | State statutes. | Federal legislation protects rights during participation in federal conservation programs. |
| **Data Gaps** | We don't know exactly how much water is pumped. | Lack of metering. | Mandatory telemetry for federal beneficiaries. |
| **Climate Uncertainty** | Historical data no longer predicts future flows. | Climate change. | Use "stress test" hydrology for planning, not just historical averages. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Consumptive Use Requirement**: Amend WaterSMART authorization to require that a percentage of saved water remain in the stream.
2. **Data Transparency**: Mandate OpenET (satellite evapotranspiration data) use for verifying water savings.
3. **Decoupling**: Fully decouple crop insurance subsidies from production decisions on marginal lands.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **WaterSMART**: Reauthorization every 5 years.
- **Aquifer Report**: Biennial USGS report triggers review of program effectiveness.
