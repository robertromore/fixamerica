# Water & Climate Resilience: Legislation

## Overview

Legislation should modernize irrigation systems, expand recharge capacity, and align water governance with climate resilience goals.

## Model Federal Bills

### 1. Irrigation Modernization and Efficiency Act

**Purpose**: Provide grants and low-interest loans for canal lining, pump upgrades, and precision irrigation technologies.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Irrigation Modernization and Efficiency Act."

SEC. 2. GRANTS.
Authorize grants and loans for irrigation efficiency upgrades tied to verified water savings.
```

**Explanation**: Reduces water loss and improves reliability.

**Challenges**: Matching requirements and maintenance capacity.

### 2. Managed Aquifer Recharge and Storage Act

**Purpose**: Fund recharge basins, floodplain restoration, and off-season storage to rebuild aquifers.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Managed Aquifer Recharge and Storage Act."

SEC. 2. PROGRAM.
Authorize funding for recharge basins, floodplain restoration, and groundwater storage pilots.
```

**Explanation**: Builds drought reserves and reduces overdraft.

**Challenges**: Land availability and permitting.

### 3. Basin Governance and Data Transparency Act

**Purpose**: Support basin-level compacts, data-sharing platforms, and drought triggers with equity safeguards.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Basin Governance and Data Transparency Act."

SEC. 2. SUPPORT.
Authorize funding for basin-level compacts, monitoring systems, and shared data platforms.
```

**Explanation**: Improves allocation coordination and transparency.

**Challenges**: Multi-state alignment and data privacy.

### 4. Resilience-Linked Insurance and Disaster Reform Act

**Purpose**: Tie crop insurance and disaster relief to verified resilience practices and water plans.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Resilience-Linked Insurance and Disaster Reform Act."

SEC. 2. INCENTIVES.
Authorize premium discounts and disaster relief bonuses for verified water conservation and resilience plans.
```

**Explanation**: Incentivizes proactive resilience.

**Challenges**: Actuarial updates and compliance verification.

## State Model Legislation

States can adopt "Water Resilience and Recharge Acts" that:

- Establish water banking and trading frameworks.
- Fund irrigation modernization and drought monitoring.
- Require basin-level resilience planning.

## Regulatory Framework

- Bureau of Reclamation should align WaterSMART funding with verified resilience outcomes.
- USDA NRCS should expand technical assistance for irrigation upgrades and recharge projects.
- USDA RMA should incorporate water resilience metrics into insurance programs.

## Legal Considerations

- Data privacy: Protect proprietary water use and farming data.
- Preemption: Federal baselines should allow states to exceed standards.
- Enforcement: Require audits and clawbacks for misuse of resilience funds.
- Sunset and review: GAO review every five years on water savings and resilience outcomes.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Savings overstatement | Projects claim water savings without verification | Medium |
| Basin imbalance | Funding flows to already strong districts | High |
| Data gaps | Monitoring systems fail to integrate | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Maintenance deficits | Infrastructure degrades after upgrades | Limited upkeep funding |
| Governance conflict | Disputes slow allocations | Fragmented compacts |
| Equity gaps | Smaller districts lack access to funds | Matching requirements |

### Rectification Procedures

1. Require verified savings and maintenance plans for funded projects.
2. Set aside funding for underserved districts and tribal nations.
3. Standardize data reporting for basin-wide monitoring.

### General Implementation Concerns

Coordinate USDA, Reclamation, and state agencies to avoid duplication and align resilience goals.
