# Water & Climate Resilience: Solutions

## Overview

Addressing agricultural water challenges requires an integrated approach that balances supply enhancement with demand management, modernizes aging infrastructure while building new resilience capacity, strengthens governance while respecting state authority, and prepares for climate risks while maintaining production. The solutions proposed here aim to sustain American agricultural productivity for the long term by addressing infrastructure backlogs, aquifer depletion, drought vulnerability, and climate adaptation gaps.

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Balance supply and demand** | Both infrastructure investment and efficiency/conservation are necessary; neither alone suffices |
| **Prioritize resilience** | Investments should reduce vulnerability to drought, flood, and climate variability |
| **Respect state authority** | Federal programs should work within state water law while providing funding and coordination |
| **Ensure equity** | Small producers, tribal nations, and underserved communities must have access to programs |
| **Base decisions on data** | Real-time monitoring and shared data systems should inform water management |
| **Plan for climate change** | Infrastructure and programs must incorporate climate projections, not just historical conditions |
| **Support transitions** | Communities facing water loss need economic diversification and transition support |
