# Water & Climate Resilience

Water and climate resilience underpins the ability of American agriculture to withstand droughts, floods, and extreme heat while maintaining reliable food production. The United States faces escalating water stress—agriculture accounts for approximately 80% of consumptive water use nationally, and critical aquifers like the Ogallala are declining at unsustainable rates. Climate change intensifies these challenges through more frequent droughts, extreme precipitation events, and shifting seasonal patterns.
