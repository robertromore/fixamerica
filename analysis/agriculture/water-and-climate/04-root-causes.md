# Water & Climate Resilience: Root Causes

## Overview

Water scarcity and climate vulnerability persist in American agriculture because multiple interlocking systems—over-allocation of water rights, aging infrastructure, fragmented governance, and climate change—create conditions where historical patterns of use cannot continue. Understanding these root causes reveals why technical solutions alone cannot address challenges that are fundamentally about allocation, governance, and long-term investment.

## Physical Resource Causes

### Over-Allocation

**More Rights Than Water**

| Basin | Allocation Status |
|-------|-------------------|
| Colorado River | 16.5 MAF rights, ~13 MAF flow |
| Central Valley | Over-subscribed |
| High Plains Aquifer | Mining groundwater |
| Rio Grande | Chronic shortage |

**Consequences**

| Consequence | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Junior rights insecure | Uncertainty for recent users |
| Environmental flows sacrificed | Ecosystem damage |
| Conflict between users | Agriculture vs. cities |
| Inflexible system | Hard to reallocate |

### Groundwater Depletion

**Aquifer Mining**

| Aquifer | Status | Consequence |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Ogallala | 30%+ depleted in some areas | Irrigation declining |
| Central Valley | Overdraft continues | Subsidence, wells deepening |
| Central Arizona | Depleting | CAP dependence |
| Various others | Local concerns | Varied |

**Why Depletion Continues**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Weak governance | Many states don't regulate |
| Property rights | Water seen as property |
| Cost externality | Pumpers don't pay full cost |
| Short-term economics | Keep farming while water lasts |

### Climate Change Impacts

**Observed Changes**

| Impact | Scale | Region |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Temperature increase | 2-4°F since 1900 | Nationwide |
| Drought intensification | Increased frequency | Southwest, Plains |
| Precipitation shifts | Timing changes | Snowpack regions |
| Extreme events | More frequent | Nationwide |

**Agricultural Consequences**

| Impact | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Reduced snowpack | Earlier runoff, less storage |
| Higher evapotranspiration | Increased crop water demand |
| Heat stress | Yield impacts |
| Growing season shifts | Phenology changes |

## Infrastructure Causes

### Aging Systems

**Infrastructure Condition**

| System | Age | Condition |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| Reclamation dams | 50-100+ years | Aging |
| Canal systems | 50-100+ years | Leaking |
| Levees | Varied | Deferred maintenance |
| On-farm systems | Varied | Mixed modernization |

**Deferred Maintenance**

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Budget constraints | Repair backlog |
| Revenue limitations | Can't raise rates enough |
| Federal role unclear | Shared responsibility gaps |
| Safety concerns | Dam safety investments |

### Efficiency Gaps

**On-Farm Losses**

| Source | Loss |
|--------|------|
| Flood irrigation | 40-60% efficiency |
| Unlined canals | Significant seepage |
| Distribution losses | 10-30% in some systems |
| Aging equipment | Inefficient application |

**Why Modernization Lags**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Capital requirements | High upfront cost |
| Return on investment | Long payback period |
| Technical assistance | Expertise needed |
| System constraints | Individual vs. system upgrade |

### Climate Mismatch

**Infrastructure-Climate Gap**

| System | Design Assumption | Reality |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Reservoirs | Historical flows | Reduced inflow |
| Canals | Reliable supply | Variable supply |
| Levees | Historical flood | Extreme events |
| Drainage | Historical precipitation | Intense storms |

## Governance Causes

### Fragmented Authority

**Who Governs Water**

| Level | Role | Limitation |
|-------|------|------------|
| Federal agencies | Infrastructure, quality | Limited allocation authority |
| State agencies | Water rights, planning | Vary dramatically |
| Local districts | Operations, delivery | Parochial interests |
| Tribal nations | Reserved rights | Often unquantified |

**Coordination Challenges**

| Challenge | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Interstate conflicts | Compact disputes |
| Federal-state tension | Authority uncertainty |
| Local fragmentation | Hundreds of districts |
| Groundwater-surface split | Often governed separately |

### Water Rights Rigidity

**Legal Framework Limitations**

| Limitation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Use it or lose it | Discourages conservation |
| Senior priority | Inflexible in shortage |
| Beneficial use definitions | May not include environment |
| Transfer barriers | Hard to reallocate |

**Why Reform Is Difficult**

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Property rights concerns | Constitutional questions |
| Senior rights holders | Oppose change |
| State sovereignty | Federal role limited |
| Compact constraints | Interstate agreements rigid |

### Data and Monitoring Gaps

**Information Limitations**

| Gap | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| Groundwater data | Many wells unmetered |
| Real-time monitoring | Limited in rural areas |
| Climate projections | Local scale uncertain |
| Water use tracking | Incomplete accounting |

## Economic Causes

### Underpriced Water

**Pricing Issues**

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Historical subsidies | Cost below true value |
| Delivery cost only | Doesn't reflect scarcity |
| No externality pricing | Depletion not priced |
| Competing uses | Agricultural often cheapest |

**Subsidy Structure**

| Subsidy | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Reclamation repayment | Below full cost |
| Energy costs | Subsidized pumping |
| Tax treatment | Depreciation for irrigation |
| Crop insurance | Covers drought losses |

### Capital Access Barriers

**Investment Challenges**

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| High upfront costs | Modernization deferred |
| Long payback | Risky for farmers |
| Lending constraints | Hard to finance |
| Program limitations | Cost-share not sufficient |

### Short-Term Economics

**Time Horizon Mismatch**

| Pressure | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Annual crop economics | Short-term decisions |
| Land prices | Capitalize on current water |
| Debt service | Must maximize current income |
| Uncertainty | Discourages long-term investment |

## Interconnections and Feedback Loops

### The Depletion Cycle

```text
Over-allocation → shortage in dry years →
groundwater pumping increases → aquifer depletion →
deeper wells needed → higher costs →
some land fallowed → pressure to pump more elsewhere →
continued depletion
```

### The Infrastructure Decay Loop

```text
Aging infrastructure → increasing losses →
reduced efficiency → higher costs →
deferred maintenance → further decay →
crisis repairs → still no modernization
```

### The Climate Adaptation Gap

```text
Climate change → reduced water supply →
shortage response → temporary measures →
return to normal when wet → no adaptation →
next drought more severe → crisis response again
```

### The Governance Gridlock Loop

```text
Fragmented authority → coordination failure →
crisis emerges → temporary fixes →
no structural reform → authority still fragmented →
next crisis inevitable
```

## Why Traditional Approaches Fall Short

### Infrastructure Investment Alone

| Limitation | Why |
|------------|-----|
| Supply expansion limited | Best sites built |
| Climate change | New infrastructure faces same climate |

| Environmental constraints | Regulatory barriers |

### Efficiency Programs Alone

| Limitation | Why |
|------------|-----|
| Saved water reallocated | May not reduce overall use |
| System constraints | Individual efficiency limited |
| Capital requirements | Not everyone can afford |
| Rebound effects | Efficiency enables expansion |

### Market Solutions Alone

| Limitation | Why |
|------------|-----|
| Transaction costs | Complex transfers |
| Third-party impacts | Effects on neighbors, environment |
| Junior rights sellers | Most vulnerable sell |
| Speculation concerns | Financial buyers |

### Disaster Response Alone

| Limitation | Why |
|------------|-----|
| Reactive | After damage done |
| Short-term | Returns to status quo |
| Moral hazard | May encourage risk |
| Expensive | Emergency costs high |

## Intervention Points

### High-Leverage Opportunities

1. **Groundwater governance**: Establish sustainable pumping
2. **Water rights flexibility**: Enable reallocation
3. **Infrastructure modernization**: Efficiency investment
4. **Climate planning**: Forward-looking management
5. **Basin coordination**: Governance improvement
6. **Pricing reform**: Reflect true scarcity

### Structural vs. Incremental

| Approach | Examples | Potential |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Structural | Water rights reform, governance restructuring | High but difficult |
| Incremental | EQIP, WaterSMART expansion | Achievable, insufficient alone |
| Crisis-driven | Shortage sharing, emergency fallowing | Reactive, not sustainable |
