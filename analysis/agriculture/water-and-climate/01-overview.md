# Water & Climate Resilience

## Overview

Water and climate resilience underpins the ability of American agriculture to withstand droughts, floods, and extreme heat while maintaining reliable food production. The United States faces escalating water stress—agriculture accounts for approximately 80% of consumptive water use nationally, and critical aquifers like the Ogallala are declining at unsustainable rates. Climate change intensifies these challenges through more frequent droughts, extreme precipitation events, and shifting seasonal patterns.

This subtopic covers irrigation systems, groundwater management, watershed restoration, and climate adaptation strategies that protect agricultural productivity while sustaining rural communities and ecosystems. As climate extremes intensify, water availability becomes less predictable, placing pressure on irrigation-dependent production systems and on states managing over-allocated river basins like the Colorado and Rio Grande.

Resilience requires integrating infrastructure investments (dams, reservoirs, conveyance modernization), demand-management tools (precision irrigation, soil moisture sensing, water markets), and governance reforms (water rights, interstate compacts, groundwater management districts). It also demands preparing for climate-driven risks—heat stress on crops and livestock, pest and disease shifts, wildfire smoke impacts—and linking these challenges to finance, insurance, and conservation programs.

## Key Questions

### Water Supply and Infrastructure

- Which irrigation modernization projects yield the greatest water savings per dollar, and how can they be scaled?
- How should aging federal water infrastructure be rehabilitated and adapted for changing conditions?
- What role should expanded storage, conveyance efficiency, and water recycling play in water supply strategies?

### Groundwater Sustainability

- How can federal policy support sustainable groundwater management without preempting state authority?
- What combination of managed aquifer recharge, pumping limits, and water markets can stabilize declining aquifers?
- How should monitoring, data collection, and reporting be improved to track groundwater conditions?

### Climate Adaptation

- How can crop insurance and disaster relief incorporate water availability and climate resilience metrics?
- What climate-smart practices most effectively reduce water demand while maintaining productivity?
- How should agriculture prepare for compound climate risks (drought + heat + wildfire)?

### Governance and Equity

- What governance reforms ensure equitable water allocation under growing scarcity?
- How can interstate compacts be modernized to incorporate climate projections and ecosystem needs?
- How should tribal water rights be recognized and implemented in basin planning?

## Why This Matters

### Food Security

Water availability directly determines agricultural productivity:

- **Production stability**: Irrigation enables consistent yields despite precipitation variability
- **Geographic reach**: Water infrastructure supports agriculture in otherwise arid regions
- **Quality assurance**: Reliable water enables specialty crop production with high quality standards
- **Livestock operations**: Water is essential for drinking, cooling, and forage production

### Economic Significance

Water stress creates substantial economic risk:

- **Farm income volatility**: Drought years reduce yields and income, threatening farm viability
- **Rural community impacts**: Water shortages affect agricultural employment and local economies
- **Infrastructure investment**: Billions in water infrastructure underpins agricultural production
- **Land values**: Water access is capitalized into farmland values; loss of water devastates asset values

### Environmental Connections

Agricultural water use intersects ecosystem health:

- **Streamflow impacts**: Agricultural diversions reduce flows for fish and wildlife
- **Aquifer depletion**: Groundwater pumping affects surface water, springs, and wetlands
- **Water quality**: Irrigation return flows carry nutrients, pesticides, and salts
- **Hypoxic zones**: Nutrient runoff contributes to Gulf of Mexico dead zone and similar impacts

### Climate Imperative

Climate change magnifies water challenges:

- **Increased demand**: Higher temperatures increase crop water requirements
- **Reduced supply**: Drought, earlier snowmelt, and reduced snowpack affect water availability
- **Extreme events**: Both drought and flood risks are increasing
- **Compound impacts**: Heat stress, wildfire, and water shortage often occur together
