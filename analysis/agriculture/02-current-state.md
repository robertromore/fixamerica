# Agriculture Policy: Current State

## Overview

U.S. agriculture encompasses approximately 900 million acres of farmland, an export-oriented commodity market, and countless small- and midsize operations that feed domestic demand. Producers rely on a patchwork of crop insurance, conservation, and commodity programs to manage weather shocks, while consumers experience regional food deserts, rising retail prices, and supply-chain bottlenecks driven by consolidation. The sector faces structural challenges from aging operators, increasing concentration, climate volatility, and labor shortages.

## Farm Structure and Demographics

### Farm Size Distribution

| Category | Number | Share of Farms | Share of Production |
|----------|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Small family farms** (<$350K sales) | 1.9 million | 89% | 21% |
| **Midsize family farms** ($350K-$1M) | 108,000 | 5% | 17% |
| **Large family farms** (>$1M) | 83,000 | 4% | 46% |
| **Nonfamily farms** | 57,000 | 3% | 16% |

| Hispanic/Latino operators | 3.4% | Increasing | USDA Census 2022 |
| Black operators | 1.3% | Slight increase | USDA Census 2022 |

**Aging Workforce Crisis:**

- Average age of principal operators has risen from 50.3 (1978) to 58.1 (2022)
- Only 9% of principal operators are under age 35
- 34% of principal operators are over 65
