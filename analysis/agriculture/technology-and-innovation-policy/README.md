# Technology & Innovation Policy

Technology and innovation policy in agriculture shapes how research funding, data governance, and commercialization pathways translate into productivity gains, climate resilience, and equitable access across the farming sector. The United States maintains the world's most extensive agricultural research system—combining USDA agencies, land-grant universities, and private-sector innovation—yet adoption of new technologies remains deeply uneven. Large operations with capital, technical staff, and connectivity readily adopt precision agriculture, AI-driven decision tools, and advanced automation, while small and midsize farms face financing barriers, data privacy concerns, and limited technical assistance.
