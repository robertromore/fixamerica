## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Extension and Access First

- **Bridges**: Conservative, Centrist, Liberal
- **Core agreement**: Expand extension and equipment access without heavy mandates.
- **Policy**: Fund extension staffing and precision access grants, delay data mandates.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept sequencing; conservatives accept funding.
- **Viability**: High; strong shared benefit.

### Compromise 2: Data Rights with Opt-In Portability

- **Bridges**: Conservative, Centrist, Liberal
- **Core agreement**: Protect farmer data while avoiding coercive mandates.
- **Policy**: Opt-in portability standards with incentives for compliant platforms.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept opt-in; skeptics accept baseline standards.
- **Viability**: Medium-high; depends on industry buy-in.

### Compromise 3: AI Assurance Pilots

- **Bridges**: Centrist, Progressive, Populist
- **Core agreement**: Test AI governance without freezing innovation.
- **Policy**: Pilot audits and disclosures for USDA-funded tools first.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept pilots; industry accepts limited audits.
- **Viability**: Medium; hinges on governance design.

## Strategic Implications

- Most viable coalition centers on extension expansion and precision access grants.
- Key obstacle is data governance mandates and AI transparency requirements.
- Bad-faith risk appears limited; focus on pilots and farmer-controlled data rights.
- Recommended approach: pass extension and access acts first, then phase in data rights and AI assurance.
