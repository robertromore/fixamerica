# Technology & Innovation Policy: Stakeholders

## Overview

Agricultural technology and innovation policy involves a diverse ecosystem of stakeholders—from farmers who adopt and generate data to research institutions developing new tools, from technology companies commercializing innovations to policymakers shaping funding and governance. Understanding who is affected, who holds power, and where interests align or conflict is essential for designing policies that accelerate equitable adoption, protect farmer rights, and maintain a vibrant innovation ecosystem.
