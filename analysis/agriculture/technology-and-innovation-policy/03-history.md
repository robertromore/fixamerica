## Lessons from History

### What Has Worked

1. **Public R&D investment**: Created productivity gains available to all
2. **Extension system**: Translated research to practice
3. **Federal-state partnership**: Sustained funding, local adaptation
4. **Open access to knowledge**: Public research broadly accessible
5. **Farmer networks**: Accelerated adoption through peer learning

### What Has Not Worked

1. **Declining public investment**: Shifted benefits to private IP holders
2. **One-size-fits-all adoption**: Small farms left behind
3. **Ignoring data governance**: Created farmer vulnerability
4. **Siloed research**: Productivity focus missed environmental costs
5. **Extension underfunding**: Capacity gaps in new technology

### Unresolved Challenges

| Challenge | Current Status |
|-----------|----------------|
| Public R&D funding | Flat or declining real terms |
| Data ownership | Voluntary standards, farmer concerns |
| Technology access equity | Small farms underserved |
| Rural connectivity | Major investments begin, gaps remain |
| Extension capacity | Underfunded relative to need |
| Climate adaptation | Tools emerging, adoption uneven |
