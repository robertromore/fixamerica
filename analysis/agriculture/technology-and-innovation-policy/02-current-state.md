# Technology & Innovation Policy: Current State

## Overview

The U.S. agricultural technology landscape reflects both remarkable innovation capacity and persistent adoption gaps. USDA research agencies, land-grant universities, and private firms continue to drive advances in precision agriculture, digital decision tools, and automation. However, these technologies concentrate disproportionately on large-scale operations, while small and midsize farms face financing barriers, connectivity limitations, and inadequate technical support. Data governance remains fragmented, with no clear federal framework for ownership, privacy, or interoperability. As AI and autonomous systems emerge, governance frameworks lag deployment.
