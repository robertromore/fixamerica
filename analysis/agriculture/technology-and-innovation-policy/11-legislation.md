# Technology & Innovation Policy: Legislation

## Overview

Legislation should expand applied research, protect farmer data rights, and ensure equitable adoption of precision and AI tools.

## Model Federal Bills

### 1. Agricultural Innovation and Extension Acceleration Act

**Purpose**: Expand USDA and land-grant funding for applied research, on-farm pilots, and extension staffing focused on climate-smart and productivity tools.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Agricultural Innovation and Extension Acceleration Act."

SEC. 2. GRANTS.
Authorize funding for applied research, field pilots, and extension staffing to accelerate adoption of agricultural innovations.
```

**Explanation**: Builds adoption capacity and bridges research to practice.

**Challenges**: Sustained funding and staffing pipelines.

### 2. Farm Data Rights and Interoperability Act

**Purpose**: Establish baseline data ownership, portability, and interoperability standards for farm-generated data.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Farm Data Rights and Interoperability Act."

SEC. 2. DATA RIGHTS.
Establish baseline farmer data ownership rights, portability requirements, and interoperability standards for agritech platforms.
```

**Explanation**: Protects farmers while enabling collaboration and innovation.

**Challenges**: Industry resistance and enforcement.

### 3. Precision Access and Equipment Sharing Act

**Purpose**: Provide grants and loans for shared precision equipment pools and technical assistance for small and midsize farms.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Precision Access and Equipment Sharing Act."

SEC. 2. PROGRAM.
Authorize grants and loans for cooperative equipment pools and training programs.
```

**Explanation**: Reduces adoption costs for smaller operations.

**Challenges**: Equipment maintenance and cooperative management.

### 4. Agricultural AI Assurance and Transparency Act

**Purpose**: Require explainability, bias audits, and disclosure standards for AI tools used in federal programs or procurement.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Agricultural AI Assurance and Transparency Act."

SEC. 2. STANDARDS.
Establish AI transparency and audit standards for tools used in USDA programs.
```

**Explanation**: Ensures AI tools are accountable and transparent.

**Challenges**: Balancing standards with innovation pace.

## State Model Legislation

States can adopt "AgTech Equity and Data Rights Acts" that:

- Establish state data governance offices aligned with federal standards.
- Fund equipment-sharing cooperatives and regional innovation hubs.
- Require AI tool disclosures for state-funded programs.

## Regulatory Framework

- USDA OCIO should publish data governance standards and enforcement mechanisms.
- USDA and NIFA should align research grants with interoperability requirements.
- USDA should require AI disclosure and audit protocols for tools used in USDA programs.

## Legal Considerations

- Data privacy: ensure farmer ownership and consent for data use.
- Preemption: federal baseline should allow states to exceed requirements.
- Enforcement: audits and penalties for data misuse or false AI claims.
- Sunset and review: GAO review every five years on adoption and equity outcomes.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Vendor lock-in | Platforms block data portability | High |
| AI opacity | Tools provide recommendations without explainability | Medium |
| Unequal access | Grants favor larger farms | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Extension gaps | Limited staffing for tech support | Underfunded extension budgets |
| Data fragmentation | Inconsistent standards | Voluntary governance |
| Capital barriers | Small farms lack financing | Credit constraints |

### Rectification Procedures

1. Require data portability and enforce interoperability standards in grant terms.
2. Fund extension tech specialists and shared equipment pools.
3. Set aside adoption grants for small and underserved producers.

### General Implementation Concerns

Coordinate USDA, NIFA, and state partners to avoid duplicative reporting and ensure consistent standards.
