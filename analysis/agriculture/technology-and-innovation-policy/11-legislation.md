# Technology and Innovation Policy: Legislation

## Overview

Agricultural technology policy stands at a crossroads. While precision agriculture, genomics, and automation offer immense potential to increase productivity and sustainability, the current trajectory concentrates power in the hands of a few dominant agribusiness firms. Farmers increasingly face a "digital lock-in" where they do not own the data their equipment generates, cannot repair their own tractors, and rely on proprietary seeds and inputs.

The legislative framework proposed here aims to democratize agricultural innovation. It establishes clear property rights for agricultural data, mandates interoperability to prevent vendor lock-in, and revitalizes the public agricultural research system to ensure innovation serves the public good—not just shareholder value. This approach treats agricultural data as a farmer's asset, not a corporate resource, and views public research as essential infrastructure for a resilient food system.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for agricultural technology reform. Congress has broad authority under the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) to regulate data practices and intellectual property affecting interstate commerce, and under the Patent and Copyright Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 8) to adjust intellectual property regimes.*

## Federal Legislation

### The Agricultural Data Rights and Sovereignty Act

**Purpose**: To establish clear ownership rights for farmers over the data generated by their operations, prohibit unauthorized use of that data by technology providers, and ensure data portability.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Data Ownership**: Codifies that data generated by agricultural equipment, sensors, and operations belongs to the farmer, not the equipment manufacturer or software provider.
2. **Prohibition on Insider Trading**: Bans agribusinesses from using aggregated farmer data to speculate in commodity markets or manipulate input prices.
3. **Data Portability**: Mandates that agricultural data platforms allow users to export their data in a standardized, machine-readable format.
4. **Consent Requirements**: Requires explicit, opt-in consent for any third-party sharing or secondary use of farmer data.
5. **Algorithmic Transparency**: Requires companies to disclose the variables and weighting used in agronomic recommendation algorithms.

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To protect the proprietary data of agricultural producers and ensure fair competition in digital agriculture markets.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Agricultural Data Rights and Sovereignty Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Modern agricultural equipment generates vast amounts of data regarding soil health, crop yields, and farming practices, with the average large-scale operation producing over 500,000 data points per field per season (American Farm Bureau Federation, 2023).
(2) This data is currently collected and monetized by equipment manufacturers and agribusinesses, often without the producer's full knowledge or fair compensation; the agricultural data market is valued at over $4 billion annually and growing at 14 percent per year (MarketsandMarkets, 2024).
(3) Aggregated agricultural data provides a significant informational advantage in commodity markets, potentially allowing companies to trade against farmers' interests.
(4) Only 27 percent of farms with less than $250,000 in sales use precision agriculture technologies, compared to 80 percent of farms with over $1 million in sales, threatening to accelerate consolidation (USDA NASS, 2023).
(5) Public agricultural research spending has declined by one-third in real terms since 2002, while private R&D has surged, increasingly tying innovation to proprietary platforms (USDA Economic Research Service, 2024).

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) AGRICULTURAL DATA.—The term "agricultural data" means any data generated by the operation of agricultural equipment or farming activities on a specific farm operation, including yield maps, soil sensor readings, application records, and machine telemetry.
(2) DATA AGGREGATOR.—The term "data aggregator" means any entity that collects, stores, or analyzes agricultural data from multiple farm operations.
(3) ALGORITHMIC RECOMMENDATION.—The term "algorithmic recommendation" means any computer-generated advice on planting, input application, or management practices derived from analysis of agricultural data.
(4) INTEROPERABILITY.—The term "interoperability" means the ability of agricultural data systems from different providers to exchange and use data without loss of content or functionality.

SEC. 4. FARMER DATA OWNERSHIP.

(a) OWNERSHIP.—Agricultural data shall be the sole property of the agricultural producer who generated it.
(b) LICENSE.—A producer may grant a limited license to a data aggregator for specific services, but such license shall not transfer ownership rights.
(c) REVOCATION.—A producer may revoke a data license at any time and require the deletion of their data from the aggregator's systems.

SEC. 5. PROHIBITED PRACTICES.

(a) MARKET MANIPULATION.—It shall be unlawful for any data aggregator to use non-public agricultural data to trade in commodity futures or derivatives markets.
(b) PRICE DISCRIMINATION.—It shall be unlawful for an input supplier to use individual farm data to engage in algorithmic price discrimination for seeds, chemicals, or equipment.

SEC. 6. INTEROPERABILITY AND PORTABILITY.

(a) STANDARD.—The Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, shall establish open standards for agricultural data interoperability.
(b) PORTABILITY.—Any platform collecting agricultural data must provide a mechanism for users to download their data in a format compliant with the standards established under subsection (a) at no cost.

SEC. 7. ENFORCEMENT.

(a) FTC AUTHORITY.—A violation of this Act shall be treated as an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act.
(b) PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.—Any producer injured by a violation of this Act may bring a civil action to recover damages and reasonable attorney's fees.

SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to the Federal Trade Commission $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2027 through 2031 for enforcement of this Act.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Reverses the current "terms of service" reality where manufacturers claim ownership of data. It treats farm data like property.
- **Section 5**: Prevents the "surveillance capitalism" model in agriculture where a company knows a farmer's yield before the farmer does and uses that info to set prices or trade futures.
- **Section 6**: Breaks "vendor lock-in" by ensuring farmers can move their data from a John Deere system to a Climate Corp system or an independent tool.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Issue Interoperability Standards | 1 year after enactment | USDA / NIST |
| Compliance Deadline for Platforms | 2 years after enactment | Ag Tech Companies |
| First FTC Enforcement Report | 3 years after enactment | FTC |

**Challenges**:

- **Technical Standards**: Defining a universal data standard for complex agronomic data is technically difficult.
- **Industry Resistance**: Tech companies argue that aggregated data products are their intellectual property.

**Refinements**:

- Include a "safe harbor" for data sharing with university researchers for public-good research.

### The Precision Agriculture Equity and Innovation Act

**Purpose**: To ensure that the benefits of precision agriculture technologies reach small, mid-sized, and diversified farms, preventing a "technology gap" that accelerates consolidation.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Technology Access Grants**: Provides cost-share grants for small and mid-sized farms to purchase precision agriculture equipment and software.

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To promote equitable access to precision agriculture technologies and support independent innovation.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Precision Agriculture Equity and Innovation Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Precision agriculture technologies can reduce input costs and environmental impacts, but high upfront costs bar entry for small and mid-sized farms.
(2) The "digital divide" in agriculture threatens to accelerate consolidation as only large operations can afford efficiency-enhancing tools.
(3) Independent, non-commercial advice on agricultural technology is scarce, leaving farmers reliant on vendor sales representatives.

SEC. 3. TECHNOLOGY ACCESS GRANTS.

(a) PROGRAM.—The Secretary of Agriculture shall establish a competitive grant program to assist small and mid-sized farm operations in adopting precision agriculture technologies.
(b) PRIORITY.—Priority shall be given to applicants who are beginning farmers, socially disadvantaged farmers, or veterans.

    (3) $250,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $275,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3**: Levels the playing field by subsidizing the high capital cost of efficiency tools for smaller operators who otherwise couldn't compete.
- **Section 4**: Creates a public-option alternative to proprietary tech ecosystems (like John Deere's), fostering a "Linux for Agriculture."
- **Section 5**: Restores the role of the Extension agent as an unbiased advisor, countering the influence of sales reps who double as "agronomists."

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Establish Grant Criteria | 180 days after enactment | USDA NIFA |
| Launch Digital Extension Corps | FY 2027 | USDA / Land Grants |

**Challenges**:

- **Adoption**: Technology requires training; buying the gadget isn't enough.
- **Maintenance**: Open source tools often lack the support networks of commercial products.

**Refinements**:

- Require grant recipients to participate in user groups to build community support capacity.

### The Public Agricultural Research Revitalization Act

**Purpose**: To reverse the decades-long decline in public agricultural R&D, shifting focus from yield maximization to resilience, agroecology, and public-domain crop varieties.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Funding Surge**: Doubles funding for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) and Agricultural Research Service (ARS) over 5 years.
2. **Public Cultivar Development**: Mandates dedicated funding for developing finished public crop varieties that farmers can save and replant.
3. **Agroecology Priority**: Requires at least 50% of research funding to support agroecological systems, soil health, and climate resilience.
4. **Intellectual Property Reform**: Prohibits the patenting of seeds developed with federal funds; requires open licensing.
5. **Regional Research Hubs**: Establishes regional centers focused on local food systems and climate adaptation.

**Draft Text**:

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To revitalize the public agricultural research system and ensure innovation serves the public interest.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Public Agricultural Research Revitalization Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Public agricultural research spending has declined by one-third since 2002, while private R&D has surged.
(2) Private research naturally focuses on proprietary products (like patented seeds and chemicals) rather than management practices or public-domain varieties.
(3) A robust public research system is essential for addressing climate change, water scarcity, and food security.

SEC. 3. FUNDING AUTHORIZATION.

(a) AFRI.—There is authorized to be appropriated for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2027, increasing by $200,000,000 annually through 2031.
(b) ARS.—There is authorized to be appropriated for the Agricultural Research Service $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2027, increasing by $100,000,000 annually through 2031.

SEC. 4. PUBLIC CULTIVAR DEVELOPMENT.

(a) REQUIREMENT.—Not less than $100,000,000 of funds appropriated annually under this Act shall be used for the development of publicly available, regionally adapted crop cultivars.
(b) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.—Cultivars developed with funds under this section shall remain in the public domain and shall not be subject to utility patents that restrict seed saving or research.

SEC. 5. AGROECOLOGY PRIORITY.

The Secretary shall ensure that not less than 50 percent of competitive grant funding is awarded to projects that advance agroecological practices, soil health, and diversified farming systems.

SEC. 6. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

The Secretary shall submit an annual report to Congress detailing the allocation of research funds and the specific public benefits derived from funded projects.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3**: Reverses the privatization of agricultural science. Public money funds "knowledge" (how to farm better); private money funds "products" (what to buy). We need more knowledge.
- **Section 4**: Attacks the root of seed consolidation. By funding public seeds that farmers can save, it creates a competitive check on private seed prices.
- **Section 5**: Shifts the research agenda from "how to grow more corn" to "how to grow food without destroying the soil."

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Issue New Grant RFAs | FY 2027 | USDA NIFA |
| Establish IP Guidelines | 180 days after enactment | USDA / USPTO |
| First Public Cultivar Release | 3-5 years (breeding cycle) | Land Grant Universities |

**Challenges**:

- **University Resistance**: Land-grant universities rely on corporate funding and patent royalties; they may resist open-source mandates.
- **Time Lags**: Breeding new crop varieties takes 7-10 years.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Agricultural Data Protection Act

**Purpose**: To provide immediate state-level protection for farmer data rights while federal legislation is pending.

**Adaptability Notes**: States with strong privacy laws (like CA, CO) can integrate this into existing frameworks. Agricultural states (IA, NE) can frame it as property rights.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Agricultural Data Protection Act".

SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS.
(a) "Agricultural Data" means...
(b) "Technology Provider" means...

SECTION 3. DATA OWNERSHIP.
An agricultural producer owns the data generated by their farming operation. A technology provider may not sell, license, or trade such data without the producer's express, written consent.

SECTION 4. TRANSPARENCY.
Technology providers must provide a clear, plain-language notice of what data is collected, how it is used, and with whom it is shared.

SECTION 5. PORTABILITY.
Upon request, a technology provider must provide a producer with their data in a machine-readable format.

SECTION 6. ENFORCEMENT.
The Attorney General may bring an action to enforce this Act. Violations are subject to a civil penalty of up to $5,000 per violation.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3**: Establishes the core principle: the farmer owns the data.
- **Section 5**: Prevents lock-in. If a farmer fires their tech provider, they get to keep their farm's history.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) for research; USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) for data standards.

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Data Interoperability Standards**: Define the XML/JSON schemas for farm data transfer. Deadline: 1 year.
2. **Public Cultivar Licensing**: Create the "Open Source Seed License" framework for USDA-funded varieties.
3. **Digital Extension Guidelines**: Establish conflict-of-interest rules for digital extension agents.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Grant Conditions**: Withholding research funds from universities that violate open-source rules.
- **FTC Enforcement**: Policing data privacy violations as "unfair trade practices."

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Intellectual Property**: Restricting patents on publicly funded research is constitutional (Congress sets patent terms). However, retroactively invalidating existing patents would be a Taking. The legislation focuses on *future* funding conditions.

### Preemption

The federal data act should set a floor, not a ceiling, allowing states to enact stronger privacy protections (like California's CCPA).

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance relies on the "power of the purse" for universities (research funding) and FTC oversight for tech companies.

---

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **"Anonymized" Data** | Companies claim data is anonymized but re-identify it with other datasets. | High | Define "anonymized" strictly to require mathematical impossibility of re-identification. |
| **Coerced Consent** | "Take it or leave it" contracts force farmers to sign away rights to use the equipment. | High | Ban "condition of service" data waivers; data sharing must be optional. |
| **University IP Offices** | Universities spin off "startups" to patent research, bypassing public domain rules. | Medium | Apply open-licensing rules to any IP derived from federal funds, regardless of entity. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Adoption Gap** | Small farmers lack time/skill to use new tech even if free. | Human capital constraints. | Heavy investment in the "Digital Extension Corps" (human support). |
| **Legacy Equipment** | Old tractors don't generate data or support new standards. | Capital cycles. | Retrofit grants for older equipment. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Consent Definition**: Amend Section 4 to explicitly prohibit making data sharing a condition of equipment operation.
2. **Bayh-Dole Reform**: Explicitly amend the Bayh-Dole Act to exclude agricultural cultivars from the mandate to patent federally funded inventions.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **Grant Programs**: Reauthorization every 5 years (Farm Bill cycle).
- **Data Standards**: Review every 3 years to keep pace with technology.
