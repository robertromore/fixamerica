# Trade & Exports: Stakeholders

## Overview

Agricultural trade and export policy involves a complex ecosystem of stakeholders—from the farmers and ranchers whose incomes depend on export markets, to the processors and traders who move products globally, to the ports and logistics networks that enable trade flows. Understanding who is affected by trade policy, who has power to shape it, and where interests align or conflict is essential for designing reforms that expand market access equitably, support small exporters, and build resilient trade relationships.
