# Trade & Exports: Current State

## Overview

U.S. agricultural exports remain strong but face intensifying global competition, persistent trade barriers, and growing concentration risks. Annual exports range from $170 billion to $200 billion, making agriculture one of the few sectors maintaining a trade surplus. However, export growth depends on reliable port capacity, market access agreements, consistent SPS compliance, and finance tools that remain inaccessible to many small and midsize exporters. Rising competition from Brazil, Argentina, and Black Sea producers, combined with geopolitical volatility, creates ongoing uncertainty.
