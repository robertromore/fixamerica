# Trade & Exports

## Overview

Trade and exports policy shapes how U.S. agriculture competes globally while stabilizing domestic markets and protecting food security. The United States is among the world's largest agricultural exporters—with annual exports ranging from $170 billion to $200 billion in recent years—supplying grains, oilseeds, meat, dairy, and specialty crops to markets worldwide. This subtopic covers export competitiveness, trade agreements, tariff volatility, sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards, and the infrastructure and finance needed to move products to global markets.

Balanced trade policy expands market access for farmers and processors while managing risks from retaliation, geopolitical shocks, and climate disruptions. It also requires coordinated export promotion, supply chain capacity, and compliance support for small and midsize exporters who face disproportionate barriers to accessing international markets.

## Scope

This analysis addresses:

- **Export competitiveness** - Market access, trade agreements, and competitive positioning against global rivals
- **Trade barriers** - Tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and sanitary/phytosanitary (SPS) standards that restrict access
- **Export finance and promotion** - Credit guarantees, market development, and trade promotion programs
- **Trade infrastructure** - Port capacity, logistics networks, and cold chain for agricultural exports
- **Market diversification** - Strategies to reduce dependence on concentrated export destinations
- **Trade policy governance** - Negotiation, enforcement, and dispute resolution mechanisms

## Key Facts

### Export Position

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Annual agricultural exports** | $170B-$200B | Among world's largest exporters |
| **Share of farm cash receipts** | ~20-25% | Exports drive significant farm income |
| **Agricultural trade balance** | Positive (varies by year) | Net exporter most years |
| **Export-dependent crops** | Soybeans, cotton, wheat, almonds | 40-60%+ of production exported |
| **U.S. share of global trade** | 10-15% of major commodities | Declining slightly as competitors grow |

### Major Export Categories

| Category | Annual Value | Key Markets | U.S. Position |
|----------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Soybeans** | ~$25-30B | China, EU, Mexico | #1 or #2 global exporter |
| **Corn** | ~$15-20B | Mexico, Japan, China | #1 global exporter |
| **Beef and pork** | ~$20-25B combined | Japan, S. Korea, Mexico, China | Major global supplier |
| **Dairy** | ~$8-10B | Mexico, Canada, Asia | Growing export sector |
| **Tree nuts** | ~$8-10B | EU, Asia, Middle East | #1 global almond exporter |
| **Cotton** | ~$6-8B | Asia, Latin America | Major global supplier |
| **Wheat** | ~$6-8B | Asia, Latin America, Africa | Top 5 global exporter |

### Market Concentration

| Metric | Status | Risk Level |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Top 5 markets share** | 60-70% of exports | High concentration risk |
| **China share of soybeans** | 50-60% of soy exports | Very high concentration |
| **Mexico/Canada share** | 25-30% of total exports | Dependent on USMCA stability |
| **Single-commodity exposure** | Grains/oilseeds dominate | Vulnerability to sector shocks |

## Key Questions

### Market Access and Competitiveness

- How can trade policy expand market access while protecting domestic food security and farm income stability?
- What strategies best position U.S. agriculture against rising competition from Brazil, Argentina, and Black Sea exporters?
- How should trade agreements balance commodity access with specialty crop and value-added opportunities?

### Trade Barriers and Compliance

- How can SPS compliance and traceability be streamlined without compromising food safety standards?
- What mechanisms most effectively address non-tariff barriers and technical standards used to block U.S. products?
- How should the U.S. respond to retaliatory tariffs and trade disputes that disrupt agricultural markets?

### Export Finance and Promotion

- Which export financing tools best support small and midsize exporters facing capital and compliance barriers?
- How can market development programs target high-growth markets while maintaining established trade relationships?
- What role should government play in export promotion versus private sector market development?

### Infrastructure and Resilience

- How do port and logistics investments improve export reliability and reduce competitive disadvantage?
- What diversification strategies reduce dependence on concentrated export destinations and single commodities?
- How should trade policy integrate with climate adaptation and supply chain resilience strategies?

## Why This Matters

### Economic Significance

Exports drive farm income and rural employment across production regions:

- **Farm income support**: Export markets absorb surplus production that would otherwise depress domestic prices
- **Price realization**: Global demand supports commodity prices above purely domestic equilibrium
- **Rural employment**: Export-oriented agriculture sustains processing, logistics, and service jobs in rural areas
- **Trade balance**: Agricultural trade surplus partially offsets manufacturing trade deficits

### Vulnerability Risks

Export dependence creates significant exposure to disruption:

- **Geopolitical shocks**: Trade wars, sanctions, and diplomatic disputes can suddenly close major markets (China soybean tariffs cost ~$12B in 2018-2019)
- **Climate disruptions**: Droughts, floods, and extreme weather affect competitor production and shipping logistics
- **Currency volatility**: Dollar strength directly affects export competitiveness and price realization
- **Policy instability**: Changes in trade agreements and partner-country policies create planning uncertainty

### Strategic Implications

Agricultural trade intersects broader policy priorities:

- **Food security**: Export capacity provides diplomatic leverage and humanitarian response capability
- **Climate goals**: Efficient global production allocation can reduce agricultural emissions
- **Development policy**: Agricultural trade shapes development outcomes in importing countries
- **Rural sustainability**: Trade policy outcomes determine viability of export-dependent farming regions

## Assessment

### Current System Status

| Dimension | Status | Trend |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Export volume** | Strong | Stable to modest growth |
| **Market access** | Mixed | Competition intensifying |
| **Trade barriers** | Persistent | SPS issues growing |
| **Export finance** | Adequate for large firms | Gaps for small exporters |
| **Infrastructure** | Strained | Underinvestment in ports |
| **Market concentration** | High | Diversification limited |

### Critical Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Priority |
|-----|--------|----------|
| **Market concentration risk** | Vulnerability to single-market disruptions | High |
| **Small exporter access** | Most export activity concentrated in large firms | High |
| **SPS compliance costs** | Technical barriers restrict market entry | High |
| **Port capacity constraints** | Congestion and delays reduce competitiveness | Medium |
| **Trade enforcement** | Inconsistent response to unfair practices | Medium |
| **Climate adaptation** | Trade policy not integrated with resilience | Medium |
