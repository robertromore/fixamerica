# Trade & Exports

Trade and exports policy shapes how U.S. agriculture competes globally while stabilizing domestic markets and protecting food security. The United States is among the world's largest agricultural exporters—with annual exports ranging from $170 billion to $200 billion in recent years—supplying grains, oilseeds, meat, dairy, and specialty crops to markets worldwide. This subtopic covers export competitiveness, trade agreements, tariff volatility, sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards, and the infrastructure and finance needed to move products to global markets.
