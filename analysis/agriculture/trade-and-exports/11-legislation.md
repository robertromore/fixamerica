# Trade and Exports: Legislation

## Overview

Agricultural trade policy is a critical component of the U.S. farm economy, with approximately 20% of agricultural production exported annually. However, the sector faces increasing volatility due to geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, and non-tariff barriers. The legislative framework proposed here aims to diversify export markets to reduce reliance on single trading partners (like China), enforce fair trade practices to protect domestic producers from unfair competition, and modernize food aid programs to support global stability while benefiting American farmers.

This legislation moves beyond simple free trade agreements to a "fair and resilient trade" model. It includes robust funding for market development in emerging economies, mandatory country-of-origin labeling (COOL) to empower consumers, and stronger enforcement mechanisms against labor and environmental dumping by competitors.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for trade reform. Congress has exclusive authority under the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) "to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations."*

## Federal Legislation

### The Agricultural Market Diversification and Resilience Act

**Purpose**: To reduce the U.S. agricultural sector's reliance on a few dominant export markets by significantly expanding funding for market development in emerging economies and strengthening trade promotion programs.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **MAP and FMD Expansion**: Doubles funding for the Market Access Program (MAP) and Foreign Market Development (FMD) program to build demand in non-traditional markets (e.g., Southeast Asia, Africa).
2. **Diversification Strategy**: Mandates a USDA strategic plan to ensure no single country accounts for more than 15% of total U.S. agricultural exports by 2035.
3. **Supply Chain Resilience Grants**: Funds infrastructure improvements at ports and inland waterways to ensure reliable export logistics.
4. **Technical Assistance Corps**: Establishes a corps of trade experts to help specialty crop producers navigate phytosanitary barriers in new markets.
5. **Emergency Trade Relief Fund**: Creates a standing trust fund to support farmers impacted by retaliatory tariffs, replacing ad-hoc bailouts.

(2) EMERGING MARKET.—The term "emerging market" means a country or region with a growing middle class and low current penetration of United States agricultural products.
(3) MARKET ACCESS PROGRAM.—The term "Market Access Program" means the program established under section 203 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 5623) to promote United States agricultural exports.
(4) TRADE PROMOTION COOPERATOR.—The term "trade promotion cooperator" means a nonprofit trade association, cooperative, or state agency that partners with USDA to develop foreign markets for United States agricultural products.

SEC. 4. EXPANSION OF TRADE PROMOTION PROGRAMS.

(a) MARKET ACCESS PROGRAM.—Section 203(c) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 5623(c)) is amended by striking "$200,000,000" and inserting "$400,000,000".
(b) FOREIGN MARKET DEVELOPMENT COOPERATOR PROGRAM.—Section 702(c) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 5722(c)) is amended by striking "$34,500,000" and inserting "$69,000,000".

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Restores the purchasing power of key trade promotion programs that have been eroded by inflation, allowing U.S. products to compete with heavily subsidized foreign competitors.
- **Section 5**: Sets a clear strategic metric for diversification to prevent the geopolitical vulnerability seen during the 2018-2019 trade wars.
- **Section 6**: Addresses the physical bottlenecks that often leave crops rotting at ports or unable to move down the Mississippi River.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Publish Diversification Strategy | 180 days after enactment | USDA / USTR |
| Issue MAP/FMD NOFA (New Funding) | FY 2027 | USDA FAS |
| Award First Infrastructure Grants | FY 2027 | USDA AMS |

**Challenges**:

- **WTO Compliance**: Increased export subsidies could be challenged at the WTO, though MAP/FMD are generally "Green Box" (permitted) or "Amber Box" (limited) depending on structure.
- **Market Realities**: China buys so much because they have the demand; forcing diversification against market signals is difficult.

**Refinements**:

- Ensure infrastructure grants prioritize "identity preserved" shipping to support value-added exports.

### The American Food Sovereignty and Labeling Act

**Purpose**: To restore mandatory Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) for beef and pork, ensuring consumers can choose American products and producers receive fair value for domestic production.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Mandatory COOL**: Reinstates mandatory country of origin labeling for beef, pork, and dairy products.
2. **WTO Compliance Mechanism**: Establishes a mechanism to adjust labeling requirements if necessary to comply with WTO rulings, while maintaining the core objective.
3. **"Product of USA" Definition**: Codifies a strict definition requiring animals to be born, raised, and slaughtered in the U.S. to carry the label.
4. **Import Standards**: Requires imported food products to meet U.S. labor and environmental standards or face an import equalization fee.
5. **Traceability**: Mandates traceability systems to verify origin claims.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To require country of origin labeling for beef, pork, and dairy products, and to ensure fair competition.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "American Food Sovereignty and Labeling Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) United States consumers overwhelmingly support knowing the origin of their food (Consumer Federation of America).
(2) Current "Product of USA" labels can be applied to imported meat that is merely repackaged in the United States, deceiving consumers.
(3) United States ranchers are competitively disadvantaged by lower labor and environmental standards in some exporting countries.
(4) Transparency is a fundamental requirement for a free market.

SEC. 3. MANDATORY COUNTRY OF ORIGIN LABELING.

(a) AMENDMENT.—Section 281 of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1638) is amended—
    (1) by including beef, pork, and dairy products as covered commodities; and
    (2) by requiring that any product bearing a United States origin label must be derived from an animal that was born, raised, and slaughtered in the United States.

(b) IMPLEMENTATION.—The Secretary shall issue regulations to implement this section not later than 1 year after the date of enactment.

SEC. 4. IMPORT STANDARDS EQUALIZATION.

(a) STUDY.—The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator of the EPA, shall conduct a study of labor and environmental standards in countries exporting agricultural products to the United States.
(b) FEE.—If the study finds that a country's standards provide an unfair competitive advantage, the President is authorized to impose an import equalization fee.

SEC. 5. TRACEABILITY.

The Secretary shall establish a verifiable audit trail for covered commodities to ensure compliance with labeling requirements.

SEC. 6. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

The Secretary shall report annually to Congress on consumer awareness of origin labeling and the economic impact on United States producers.

SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3**: Closes the loophole where imported beef processed in the U.S. gets a "Product of USA" sticker, restoring honesty to the marketplace.
- **Section 4**: Begins to address the "race to the bottom" by penalizing imports produced under exploitative conditions.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Issue Proposed Rule | 180 days after enactment | USDA AMS |
| Final Rule Effective | Jan 1, 2027 | USDA AMS |
| Import Standards Study | 1 year after enactment | USDA / DOL / EPA |

**Challenges**:

- **Retaliation**: Canada and Mexico successfully challenged previous COOL laws at the WTO; this version attempts to navigate that but risk remains.
- **Packer Opposition**: Meatpackers strongly oppose COOL due to segregation costs.

**Refinements**:

- Include a "negotiated settlement" provision to offer trade concessions elsewhere if WTO rules against COOL, preserving the label.

### The Global Food Security and American Producer Support Act

**Purpose**: To reform U.S. international food aid programs to allow for greater flexibility while maintaining a strong role for American commodities, and to establish a strategic grain reserve.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Food Aid Reform**: Maintains the requirement that 50% of food aid be U.S. commodities, but allows 50% to be cash-based/local procurement for efficiency.
2. **Strategic Grain Reserve**: Re-establishes a farmer-owned strategic grain reserve to buffer against global price shocks and supply disruptions.
3. **Cargo Preference Reform**: Adjusts cargo preference rules to ensure competitive shipping rates for food aid.
4. **Global Nutrition**: Focuses aid on nutrient-dense foods rather than just calories.

**Draft Text**:

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To enhance global food security, support American farmers, and stabilize food prices.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Global Food Security and American Producer Support Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Global food insecurity affects over 700 million people.
(2) American farmers are the most productive in the world and play a vital role in global stability.
(3) Strategic reserves can protect both consumers and producers from extreme volatility.

SEC. 3. FOOD AID FLEXIBILITY.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 202 of the Food for Peace Act (7 U.S.C. 1722) is amended to authorize the Administrator to use up to 50 percent of funds for local and regional procurement, cash transfers, or vouchers when such methods are more efficient.
(b) U.S. COMMODITIES.—Not less than 50 percent of funds shall be used to purchase and ship United States agricultural commodities.

SEC. 4. STRATEGIC GRAIN RESERVE.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary shall establish a Farmer-Owned Strategic Grain Reserve.
(b) MECHANISM.—The Secretary shall offer storage payments to producers to hold grain off the market when prices are below the reference price, and authorize release when prices exceed 150 percent of the reference price.
(c) CAP.—The reserve shall be capped at 1 billion bushels of corn and 300 million bushels of wheat.

SEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

The Administrator of USAID shall report annually on the timeliness and cost-effectiveness of food aid delivery under the new flexibility authorities.

SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $2,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $2,600,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $2,700,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $2,800,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $2,900,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3**: Strikes a compromise between the "shipping efficiency" crowd (who want cash aid) and the "iron triangle" (shippers/farmers who want commodity aid), optimizing for speed and support.
- **Section 4**: Reintroduces a tool used successfully in the past to stabilize prices, protecting farmers from crashes and consumers from spikes.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Issue Reserve Guidelines | 180 days after enactment | USDA FSA |
| First Reserve Enrollment | Harvest 2027 | USDA FSA |
| USAID Procurement Rules | 180 days after enactment | USAID |

**Challenges**:

- **Maritime Lobby**: The shipping industry fiercely protects cargo preference (requiring U.S. ships for aid).
- **Budget Scoring**: Reserves can be scored as expensive by CBO depending on price assumptions.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Agricultural Export Promotion and Branding Act

**Purpose**: To create a state-level brand for agricultural products and fund trade missions to boost local exports.

**Adaptability Notes**: States with strong specialty crops (CA, WA, FL) can focus on consumer branding. Commodity states (IA, IL) should focus on trade missions.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Agricultural Export Promotion and Branding Act".

SECTION 2. STATE BRANDING PROGRAM.
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Department of Agriculture shall establish a "[State] Grown" branding program.
(b) ELIGIBILITY.—Products must be 100% grown or processed in the State to qualify.
(c) MARKETING.—The Department shall conduct marketing campaigns in key export markets.

SECTION 3. EXPORT TRADE MISSIONS.
(a) FUNDING.—There is established an Export Trade Mission Fund.
(b) ACTIVITIES.—The Governor and Director of Agriculture shall lead at least two trade missions annually to target markets.

SECTION 4. APPROPRIATION.
There is appropriated $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 to carry out this Act.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 2**: Builds brand equity for the state's products, allowing them to command a premium.
- **Section 3**: Direct engagement by state leadership is often critical for opening doors in foreign markets.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **COOL Regulations**: Define "born, raised, and slaughtered" verification protocols. Deadline: 1 year.
2. **MAP/FMD Criteria**: Update grant criteria to prioritize emerging markets.
3. **Reserve Rules**: Establish storage rates and release triggers for the grain reserve.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: Fines for mislabeling products under COOL.
- **Audit Authority**: USDA authority to audit supply chains for origin verification.
- **Grant Oversight**: Clawback provisions for misused trade promotion funds.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause**: Federal authority over foreign trade is plenary.
**First Amendment**: Industry may challenge COOL as "compelled speech" (as seen in *AMI v. USDA*). However, the government has a substantial interest in preventing consumer deception, which generally survives scrutiny under *Zauderer*.

### Preemption

Federal labeling laws generally preempt state labeling requirements to ensure a uniform national standard.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance relies on record-keeping audits at packing plants and retail establishments.

---

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **"Processed" Exemption** | Processed foods (e.g., roasted nuts, cured meats) exempt from COOL. | Medium | Expand COOL to include processed items with >50% single ingredient. |
| **Transshipment** | Goods shipped through a third country to mask origin. | High | Require "trace back" to farm of origin, not just port of lading. |
| **Restaurant Exemption** | Restaurants not required to label origin. | Medium | Voluntary "US Origin" certification program for restaurants. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **WTO Retaliation** | Tariffs on U.S. goods. | Trade agreements. | Negotiate compensation or accept tariffs as cost of sovereignty. |
| **Cost to Packers** | Segregation costs passed to farmers. | Efficiency loss. | Technology (RFID) to lower segregation costs. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Traceability Technology**: Mandate electronic ID (RFID) for cattle to make origin verification cheap and automatic.
2. **WTO Negotiation**: Proactively offer trade concessions in non-ag sectors to avoid retaliation against farmers.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **MAP/FMD**: Reauthorization every 5 years (Farm Bill).
- **Diversification Strategy**: Review every 3 years.
