# Trade & Exports: Legislation

## Overview

Legislation should expand market access, strengthen SPS compliance capacity, and modernize export infrastructure while protecting domestic stability.

## Model Federal Bills

### 1. Agricultural Export Diversification Act

**Purpose**: Expand market development programs and technical assistance for new export markets and value-added products.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Agricultural Export Diversification Act."

SEC. 2. PROGRAM.
Authorize grants and technical assistance to diversify agricultural export markets and support value-added products.
```

**Explanation**: Reduces market concentration risk and expands access for smaller exporters.

**Challenges**: Requires sustained funding and trade diplomacy.

### 2. SPS Compliance and Traceability Act

**Purpose**: Build shared compliance infrastructure, digital traceability tools, and faster certification pathways.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "SPS Compliance and Traceability Act."

SEC. 2. SUPPORT.
Authorize digital traceability systems and compliance hubs for exporters meeting SPS requirements.
```

**Explanation**: Reduces compliance burdens and shipment delays.

**Challenges**: Coordination across USDA, FDA, and international partners.

### 3. Export Finance and Risk Coverage Act

**Purpose**: Expand GSM-102 guarantees and establish risk insurance for exporters facing geopolitical or climate disruptions.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Export Finance and Risk Coverage Act."

SEC. 2. SUPPORT.
Expand export credit guarantees and authorize risk insurance pilots for agricultural exporters.
```

**Explanation**: Stabilizes export flows in volatile markets.

**Challenges**: Underwriting risk and avoiding market distortion.

### 4. Agricultural Port and Freight Modernization Act

**Purpose**: Invest in export corridors, intermodal hubs, and cold chain infrastructure tied to agriculture.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Agricultural Port and Freight Modernization Act."

SEC. 2. INFRASTRUCTURE.
Authorize grants for port, rail, and cold chain upgrades supporting agricultural exports.
```

**Explanation**: Reduces delays and strengthens resilience.

**Challenges**: High capital costs and multi-agency coordination.

## State Model Legislation

States can adopt "Agricultural Trade Competitiveness Acts" that:

- Create export readiness centers and SPS compliance support.
- Coordinate port and cold chain investments with federal programs.
- Provide matching funds for small exporter market development.

## Regulatory Framework

- USDA FAS should align market development funding with diversification goals.
- USDA FSIS should streamline export certification and digital documentation.
- DOT should align freight grants with agricultural export corridors.

## Legal Considerations

- Data privacy: ensure export traceability systems protect proprietary information.
- Preemption: federal baseline should allow states to exceed support levels.
- Enforcement: require audits for grant performance and export financing compliance.
- Sunset and review: GAO review every five years on export diversification outcomes.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Market concentration | Grants flow to existing dominant markets | High |
| Traceability gaps | Systems exclude smaller exporters | Medium |
| Port congestion | Funding prioritizes non-ag exports | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Compliance bottlenecks | Delayed certification and higher costs | Limited staffing |
| Market volatility | Exposure to retaliatory tariffs | Concentrated buyers |
| Financing gaps | Small exporters lack credit access | Limited underwriting flexibility |

### Rectification Procedures

1. Require diversification targets in grant scoring.
2. Set aside funding for small and midsize exporters.
3. Require corridor investments to include agricultural throughput metrics.

### General Implementation Concerns

Coordinate USDA, DOT, and USTR to avoid duplicative reporting and align trade and infrastructure policy.
