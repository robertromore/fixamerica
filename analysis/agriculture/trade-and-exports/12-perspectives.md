## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Diversification with Domestic Safeguards

- **Bridges**: Conservative, Centrist, Liberal
- **Core agreement**: Expand market access while monitoring domestic impacts.
- **Policy**: Diversification grants tied to domestic price stability metrics.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept safeguards; conservatives accept promotion funding.
- **Viability**: High; aligns with both access and stability.

### Compromise 2: SPS Compliance Hubs for Small Exporters

- **Bridges**: Progressive, Populist, Centrist
- **Core agreement**: Reduce compliance burdens for smaller exporters.
- **Policy**: Federally funded compliance hubs and digital tools with cost caps.
- **Concessions**: Regulators accept streamlined processes; exporters accept standardized reporting.
- **Viability**: Medium-high; depends on capacity.

### Compromise 3: Port Modernization First

- **Bridges**: Conservative, Centrist, Liberal
- **Core agreement**: Ports are a shared bottleneck.
- **Policy**: Prioritize port and cold chain upgrades before expanding export finance.
- **Concessions**: Export finance advocates accept sequencing; skeptics accept infrastructure spending.

## Strategic Implications

- Most viable coalition centers on port modernization and export diversification.
