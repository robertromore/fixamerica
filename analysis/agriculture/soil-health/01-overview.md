# Soil Health: Overview

## Executive Summary

Soil health is the foundation of sustainable agriculture—determining crop productivity, water quality, climate resilience, and long-term farm viability. Healthy soils with high organic matter, diverse microbial communities, and good structure retain moisture during drought, absorb heavy rainfall, cycle nutrients efficiently, and sequester carbon. Yet decades of intensive tillage, monoculture cropping, and chemical-dependent management have degraded soils across much of U.S. agricultural land, leading to erosion, compaction, declining organic matter, and increasing vulnerability to climate extremes.

Approximately 900 million tons of topsoil erode annually from U.S. cropland, while soil organic matter levels have declined 30-50% from pre-agricultural conditions in many regions. Cover crop adoption, while growing, remains at only 5-6% of cropland. The economic costs of soil degradation—reduced yields, increased input needs, downstream water pollution—exceed billions of dollars annually.

Restoring soil health requires aligning federal conservation programs, crop insurance, market incentives, and technical assistance to make soil-building practices profitable and accessible for all farmers. This means rewarding outcomes rather than just practices, reducing transition risk, ensuring tenant farmers and underserved communities can participate, and connecting soil health to water quality, climate goals, and consumer demand.

## Key Questions

### Measurement and Metrics

- Which soil health metrics (organic matter, soil organic carbon, infiltration, aggregate stability) should anchor federal incentives?
- How can measurement and verification be made affordable and accessible for small farms?
- What role should remote sensing, modeling, and soil sampling play in monitoring?
- How do we ensure measurement standards are consistent across programs and markets?

### Program Design

- How can federal conservation programs reward measurable soil health outcomes rather than just practice adoption?
- What financing models help farms cover multi-year transition costs?
- How do we ensure tenant farmers and short-term leaseholders can participate in soil health programs?
- What level of technical assistance is needed to support widespread adoption?

### Risk and Economics

- How can crop insurance be aligned with soil health practices to reduce farmer risk?
- What economic returns do soil health practices provide, and over what timeframe?
- How do we address the "split incentive" problem where tenants invest but landlords benefit?
- What role should carbon markets and ecosystem service payments play?

### Equity and Access

- How do we ensure BIPOC, beginning, and small-scale farmers have equal access to soil health programs?

## Why This Matters

### Agricultural Productivity

| Impact | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| **Yield stability** | Healthy soils improve drought and flood resilience |
| **Input efficiency** | Higher organic matter reduces fertilizer needs |
| **Pest and disease resistance** | Diverse soil biology suppresses pathogens |
| **Long-term productivity** | Soil degradation threatens future yields |
| **Farm profitability** | Reduced inputs and stable yields improve margins |

### Environmental Benefits

| Benefit | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| **Water quality** | Reduced erosion and nutrient runoff |

### Climate Resilience

Soil health is both a climate mitigation and adaptation strategy:

- **Mitigation**: Sequestering carbon in soils removes CO2 from atmosphere
