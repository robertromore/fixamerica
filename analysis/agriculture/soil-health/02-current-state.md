# Soil Health: Current State

## Overview

U.S. agricultural soils present a mixed picture: decades of degradation from intensive tillage and monoculture cropping are being partially addressed by growing adoption of conservation practices, but progress remains uneven and insufficient. Cover crop acreage has grown 50%+ since 2012 but still covers only 5-6% of cropland. No-till farming has expanded significantly but is often paired with herbicide-intensive systems rather than diversified rotations. Federal conservation programs are oversubscribed, with insufficient funding and staffing to meet demand. Meanwhile, climate change is intensifying soil stress through more frequent droughts and extreme rainfall events.
