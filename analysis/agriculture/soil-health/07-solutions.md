# Soil Health: Solutions

## Overview

Restoring soil health across U.S. agricultural lands requires a comprehensive strategy that aligns federal conservation programs, crop insurance, market incentives, and technical assistance to make soil-building practices profitable and accessible for all farmers. Effective solutions must address the economic barriers to adoption, reduce transition risk, ensure tenant farmers and underserved communities can participate, and connect soil health to water quality, climate goals, and consumer demand.
