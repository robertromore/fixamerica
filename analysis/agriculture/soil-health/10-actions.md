# Soil Health: Citizen Actions

## Overview

Improving soil health across American agriculture requires action at multiple levels—from individual farmers adopting practices to communities building support systems to advocates pushing for policy change. This guide provides concrete steps for each audience, recognizing that systemic change requires both on-farm action and enabling policy.

## For Farmers

### Getting Started with Soil Health

**Assessment First**

| Step | Method |
|------|--------|

| Extended rotation | Add one crop to rotation |
| Integrate livestock | Explore grazing partnerships |

### Building Soil Health Systems

**Cover Crop Integration**
