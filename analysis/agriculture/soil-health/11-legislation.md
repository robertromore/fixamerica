# Soil Health: Legislation

## Overview

Soil health legislation aims to transform American agriculture from a system that depletes natural resources to one that regenerates them. Current policy incentivizes yield maximization often at the expense of long-term soil fertility, leading to erosion, nutrient runoff, and loss of carbon storage capacity. The legislative strategy focuses on realigning incentives so that farmers are rewarded for building soil organic matter, increasing biodiversity, and protecting water quality.

This approach moves beyond voluntary, cost-share programs to integrate soil health metrics into the core safety net of crop insurance and commodity payments. It establishes a national soil health monitoring network, creates a "good driver discount" for conservation-minded farmers, and funds the technical assistance needed to help producers transition to regenerative practices.

---

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for soil health reform. Congress has ample authority under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) to condition agricultural subsidies on conservation practices, and under the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) to regulate environmental impacts affecting interstate waters.*

## Federal Legislation

### The Soil Health and Climate Resilience Act

**Purpose**: To establish a national soil health strategy, integrate soil metrics into federal farm programs, and provide financial and technical support for regenerative agriculture transitions.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **National Soil Health Strategy**: Mandates USDA to develop a comprehensive plan to increase soil organic carbon by 0.4% annually on working lands.
2. **Crop Insurance "Good Driver" Discount**: Authorizes a premium discount for producers who adopt risk-reducing soil health practices like cover crops and no-till.
3. **Soil Health Transition Fund**: Creates a grant program to support farmers during the 3-5 year transition period to regenerative systems when yields may temporarily dip.
4. **Conservation Compliance Modernization**: Updates "sodbuster" and "swampbuster" provisions to include soil health standards for all commodity program eligibility.
5. **Data Privacy and Research**: Establishes a firewall to protect individual producer data while allowing aggregated research on the link between soil health and yield stability.

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To improve the health of the Nation's soils, enhance climate resilience in agriculture, and support farmers in adopting regenerative practices.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Soil Health and Climate Resilience Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Healthy soil is the foundation of a productive and resilient agricultural system, yet the United States loses an estimated 5.8 tons of soil per acre annually on cropland (USDA NRCS).
(2) Increasing soil organic matter by 1 percent can increase water holding capacity by up to 20,000 gallons per acre, reducing drought risk.
(3) Agricultural soils have the potential to sequester over 250 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually if regenerative practices are widely adopted (National Academies).
(4) Current federal farm programs often disincentivize the adoption of soil health practices by prioritizing short-term yield over long-term resilience.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) SOIL HEALTH.—The term "soil health" means the continued capacity of soil to function as a vital living ecosystem that sustains plants, animals, and humans.
(2) REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE.—The term "regenerative agriculture" means farming and ranching practices that reverse climate change by rebuilding soil organic matter and restoring degraded soil biodiversity.
(3) SECRETARY.—The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Agriculture.

SEC. 4. NATIONAL SOIL HEALTH STRATEGY.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall publish a National Soil Health Strategy.
(b) GOALS.—The strategy shall establish measurable goals for—
    (1) increasing soil organic carbon on working lands;
    (2) reducing soil erosion below the soil loss tolerance (T) value; and
    (3) increasing the adoption of cover crops and diverse rotations.
(c) REPORTING.—The Secretary shall report to Congress every 2 years on progress toward these goals.

SEC. 5. CROP INSURANCE SOIL HEALTH DISCOUNT.

(a) PILOT PROGRAM.—The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation shall establish a pilot program to provide a premium discount to producers who adopt soil health practices.
(b) ELIGIBLE PRACTICES.—Practices eligible for the discount shall include—
    (1) cover cropping;
    (2) no-till or reduced tillage;
    (3) diverse crop rotations; and
    (4) integration of livestock.
(c) DISCOUNT AMOUNT.—The discount shall be actuarially sound and reflect the reduced risk of crop failure associated with improved soil health, but shall not be less than $5 per acre.

SEC. 6. SOIL HEALTH TRANSITION FUND.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established in the Treasury a fund to be known as the "Soil Health Transition Fund".
(b) GRANTS.—The Secretary shall use the Fund to provide grants to producers to offset the financial risk of transitioning to regenerative practices.
(c) TERMS.—Grants shall be available for a period of up to 5 years and may be used for—
    (1) technical assistance;
    (2) seed and equipment costs; and
    (3) income support during the transition period.

SEC. 7. CONSERVATION COMPLIANCE.

(a) AMENDMENT.—Section 1211 of the Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to include a requirement that producers maintain a minimum soil health index score, as determined by the Secretary, to remain eligible for Department benefits.
(b) PHASE-IN.—The requirement in subsection (a) shall take effect 5 years after the date of enactment of this Act.

SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $600,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $700,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $800,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 5**: Recognizes that farmers who build soil health are lower risk to the insurance system (like good drivers) and should pay lower premiums, aligning financial incentives with physical reality.
- **Section 6**: Addresses the "valley of death" in transition economics where costs rise and yields may dip before the soil system recovers and profitability increases.
- **Section 7**: Updates the basic "social contract" of farm subsidies—taxpayers support farmers, and in return, farmers must maintain the basic asset (soil) that ensures future productivity.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Publish National Strategy | 1 year after enactment | USDA NRCS |
| Launch Insurance Discount Pilot | 2027 Crop Year | USDA RMA |
| First Transition Grants | FY 2027 | USDA NRCS |
| Compliance Rulemaking | 3 years after enactment | USDA FSA/NRCS |

**Challenges**:

- **Measurement**: Defining a "soil health index" that works across diverse soil types and climates is scientifically complex.
- **Insurance Industry**: Private insurance companies may resist changes to the premium structure that complicate their actuarial models.

**Refinements**:

- Allow regional calibration of the soil health index to account for local conditions.
- Partner with land grant universities to validate the risk reduction benefits for insurers.

### The Agroforestry and Perennial Agriculture Act

**Purpose**: To accelerate the adoption of agroforestry (trees on farms) and perennial cropping systems, which offer superior soil protection and carbon sequestration compared to annual row crops.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Agroforestry Centers**: Establishes regional technical assistance centers to support alley cropping, silvopasture, and riparian buffers.
2. **Perennial Crop Research**: Doubles funding for the development of perennial grain crops (like Kernza) and oilseeds.
3. **Establishment Grants**: Provides cost-share for the high upfront costs of planting trees and perennial systems.
4. **Market Development**: Funds supply chain development for agroforestry products (nuts, fruits, timber) to ensure farmers have buyers.

**Draft Text**:

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To promote the integration of trees and perennial crops into United States agriculture.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Agroforestry and Perennial Agriculture Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Agroforestry practices can sequester 2 to 5 times more carbon per acre than treeless agricultural systems (USDA National Agroforestry Center).
(2) Perennial root systems prevent soil erosion, filter water, and improve nutrient cycling year-round.
(3) Less than 2 percent of U.S. agricultural land currently utilizes agroforestry practices, representing a massive missed opportunity.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) SILVOPASTURE.—The term "silvopasture" means the intentional combination of trees, forage plants, and livestock.
(2) ALLEY CROPPING.—The term "alley cropping" means planting rows of trees at wide spacings with a companion crop grown in the alleyways between the rows.

SEC. 4. REGIONAL AGROFORESTRY CENTERS.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary shall establish 5 regional agroforestry centers to provide technical assistance, research, and demonstration.
(b) LOCATIONS.—Centers shall be located in the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Great Plains, and West.
(c) FUNCTIONS.—Each center shall—
    (1) train extension agents and conservation planners;
    (2) conduct region-specific research on tree-crop interactions; and
    (3) maintain demonstration farms.

SEC. 5. PERENNIAL CROP DEVELOPMENT.

(a) FUNDING.—There is authorized to be appropriated $50,000,000 annually for the research and development of perennial grain and oilseed crops.
(b) PRIORITY.—Priority shall be given to crops with the potential to replace annual row crops on marginal lands.

SEC. 6. ESTABLISHMENT GRANTS.

(a) PROGRAM.—The Secretary shall establish a grant program to cover up to 75 percent of the cost of establishing agroforestry systems.
(b) ELIGIBLE COSTS.—Eligible costs include seedlings, tree protection, irrigation, and labor.

SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

The Secretary shall submit an annual report to Congress on the acreage of new agroforestry systems established and the estimated carbon sequestration achieved.

SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $125,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $175,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Overcomes the knowledge gap; most farmers don't know how to manage trees and crops together. Regional centers provide the necessary expertise.
- **Section 5**: Invests in the "holy grail" of sustainable agriculture—crops that don't need to be replanted every year, saving fuel and soil.
- **Section 6**: Addresses the financial barrier; trees take years to mature, creating a cash flow gap that grants help bridge.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Select Center Locations | 180 days after enactment | USDA Forest Service |
| Issue Grant NOFA | FY 2027 | USDA NRCS |
| First Perennial Research Awards | FY 2027 | USDA NIFA |

**Challenges**:

- **Cultural**: Row crop farmers often view trees as obstacles, not assets.
- **Tenure**: Tenant farmers (who rent 40% of land) cannot invest in long-term assets like trees without lease reform.

**Refinements**:

- Include specific provisions for long-term leases on public lands to demonstrate agroforestry.

### The Soil Monitoring and Data Act

**Purpose**: To build a national soil health monitoring network that provides the data necessary to verify carbon markets, improve crop insurance models, and track national progress.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **National Soil Monitoring Network**: Establishes a network of sentinel sites across all major soil regions to track changes in soil carbon and biology over time.
2. **Data Standardization**: Mandates the development of standard protocols for soil sampling and analysis to ensure interoperability.
3. **Producer Data Platform**: Creates a secure, voluntary platform for farmers to upload soil data and benchmark their performance against regional peers.
4. **Remote Sensing Integration**: Funds research to calibrate satellite data with ground-truth soil samples for scalable monitoring.

**Draft Text**:

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To establish a national soil health monitoring network and improve data availability for agricultural resilience.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Soil Monitoring and Data Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Accurate, longitudinal data on soil health is essential for verifying climate benefits and improving agronomic advice.
(2) Current soil datasets are fragmented, outdated, or inconsistent, hindering research and market development.
(3) A national network is needed to track the impact of management practices on soil function at scale.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL SOIL MONITORING NETWORK.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary, acting through the Natural Resources Conservation Service, shall establish a National Soil Monitoring Network.
(b) SITES.—The network shall consist of not fewer than 5,000 sentinel sites representing diverse soil types, cropping systems, and climates.
(c) MEASUREMENTS.—At each site, the Secretary shall measure soil organic carbon, bulk density, biological activity, and water infiltration at regular intervals.

SEC. 4. DATA STANDARDIZATION.

(a) PROTOCOLS.—The Secretary shall convene a technical advisory committee to develop standard protocols for soil health sampling and laboratory analysis.
(b) ADOPTION.—These protocols shall be required for all USDA-funded research and conservation programs.

SEC. 5. PRODUCER DATA PLATFORM.

(a) DEVELOPMENT.—The Secretary shall develop a secure, web-based platform for producers to voluntarily submit soil test data.
(b) BENCHMARKING.—The platform shall provide producers with anonymized benchmarking reports comparing their soil health metrics to regional averages.
(c) PRIVACY.—Data submitted to the platform shall be protected from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

SEC. 6. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

The Secretary shall publish an annual "State of the Soil" report summarizing trends observed in the monitoring network.

SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3**: Creates the "weather stations" for soil—a permanent infrastructure to track the health of the nation's land base.
- **Section 4**: Solves the "apples to oranges" problem where different labs use different methods, making data comparison impossible.
- **Section 5**: Empowers farmers with data, allowing them to see how their management compares to neighbors without revealing trade secrets.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Convene Technical Committee | 90 days after enactment | USDA NRCS |
| Publish Protocols | 1 year after enactment | USDA NRCS |
| Establish Sentinel Sites | 2 years after enactment | USDA NRCS |

**Challenges**:

- **Privacy**: Farmers are wary of sharing data that could be used for regulation. Strong statutory privacy protections are essential.
- **Cost**: Soil sampling is labor-intensive.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Healthy Soils Act

**Purpose**: To establish state-level soil health programs that complement federal efforts, focusing on local research, peer-to-peer education, and equipment sharing.

**Adaptability Notes**: States with water quality issues (e.g., Midwest) should emphasize nutrient reduction. Arid states (e.g., West) should emphasize water retention.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Healthy Soils Act".

SECTION 2. HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM.
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established within the Department of Agriculture a Healthy Soils Program.
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of the program is to promote farming and ranching practices that improve soil health, carbon sequestration, and water quality.
(c) GRANTS.—The Department may award grants to:
    (1) Producers for implementation of soil health practices;
    (2) Conservation districts for equipment sharing programs (e.g., no-till drills);
    (3) Universities for local research.

SECTION 3. HEALTHY SOILS ADVISORY BOARD.
(a) MEMBERSHIP.—The Department shall appoint an advisory board consisting of farmers, scientists, and conservationists to guide the program.
(b) DUTIES.—The Board shall recommend standards, grant priorities, and educational programming.

SECTION 4. SOIL HEALTH WEEK.
The second week of [Month] is designated as "Soil Health Week" to raise public awareness.

SECTION 5. APPROPRIATION.
There is appropriated from the General Fund $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 to carry out this Act.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 2**: Provides flexible funding for local needs, filling gaps left by rigid federal programs. Equipment sharing is particularly high-impact for small farms.
- **Section 3**: Ensures the program remains farmer-led and grounded in practical reality.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Conservation Practice Standards**: Update standards (e.g., Code 340 Cover Crop) to reflect regional soil health goals. Deadline: 1 year.
2. **Crop Insurance Rules**: RMA must define "Good Farming Practices" to explicitly include soil health practices, preventing insurers from denying claims for cover cropped land.
3. **Carbon Market Verification**: Establish rules for third-party verifiers of soil carbon credits.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: Loss of eligibility for farm programs for violation of conservation compliance.
- **Administrative Actions**: Decertification of technical service providers who falsify data.
- **Private Right of Action**: Generally not applicable, but contract disputes over carbon credits may go to court.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Takings Clause**: Mandating soil health practices on private land could be challenged as a regulatory taking. However, conditioning *voluntary* federal benefits (subsidies) on these practices is constitutional (*South Dakota v. Dole*).

### Preemption

Federal crop insurance rules generally preempt state laws. States cannot impose stricter insurance requirements but can offer additional premium subsidies (as Iowa and Illinois have done for cover crops).

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance relies on NRCS field staff and random spot checks. Satellite imagery is increasingly used to verify cover crop adoption without on-site visits.

---

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **"Paper" Cover Crops** | Farmers plant cover crops but terminate them immediately, claiming the payment without benefit. | Medium | Require minimum growing degree days or biomass accumulation before termination. |
| **Additionality** | Farmers getting paid for practices they adopted years ago. | High | Create separate "maintenance" payments for early adopters vs. "transition" payments for new ones. |
| **Tenant Exclusion** | Landlords refuse to allow practices; tenants can't sign long-term contracts. | High | Allow tenants to sign contracts with shorter terms; incentivize landlord participation. |
| **Data Privacy** | Aggregated data used to raise land rents on productive farms. | Medium | Strict statutory prohibitions on data use for rental rate setting. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Technical Capacity** | NRCS lacks staff to write plans. | Hiring freezes/attrition. | Fund "Technical Service Providers" (private consultants) to fill gaps. |
| **Regional Bias** | Programs work better in humid East than arid West. | Water limitations. | Develop region-specific practice lists (e.g., range management in West). |
| **Yield Drag** | Yields drop during transition. | Biological lag time. | Transition Fund (Section 6) specifically targets this risk. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Maintenance Payments**: Amend Section 6 to explicitly authorize payments for maintaining existing soil health stocks, preventing early adopters from plowing up soil to re-qualify.
2. **Lease Addendums**: Develop model lease addendums that share the costs and benefits of soil health between landlord and tenant.
3. **Remote Sensing**: Mandate the use of satellite verification to reduce fraud and administrative cost.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **Pilot Programs**: Sunset after 5 years unless reauthorized based on positive evaluation.
- **National Strategy**: Updated every 5 years.
