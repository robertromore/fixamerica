# Soil Health: Legislation

## Overview

Legislation should reward measurable soil improvements, reduce transition risk, and align conservation programs with risk management and water quality goals.

## Model Federal Bills

### 1. Soil Health Outcomes Accelerator Act

**Purpose**: Establish a performance-based program that pays for verified improvements in soil organic matter, infiltration, and erosion reduction.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Soil Health Outcomes Accelerator Act."

SEC. 2. OUTCOME PAYMENTS.
Authorize payments for verified soil health improvements using standardized metrics and third-party verification.
```

**Explanation**: Shifts incentives from practice adoption to measurable outcomes.

**Challenges**: Verification costs and data privacy concerns.

### 2. Soil Health Risk Management Alignment Act

**Purpose**: Align crop insurance and revenue programs with soil health practices through premium incentives and transition coverage.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Soil Health Risk Management Alignment Act."

SEC. 2. INSURANCE INCENTIVES.
Direct USDA to offer premium discounts and transition coverage for approved soil health practices.
```

**Explanation**: Reduces short-term risk for farmers adopting new practices.

**Challenges**: Actuarial data requirements and program consistency.

### 3. Regional Soil Health Hubs Act

**Purpose**: Fund regional hubs that integrate NRCS, extension, and private advisers to deliver technical assistance and equipment sharing.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Regional Soil Health Hubs Act."

SEC. 2. HUB GRANTS.
Award grants for regional soil health hubs that provide technical assistance, training, and equipment access.
```

**Explanation**: Builds local capacity and trusted advisory networks.

**Challenges**: Long-term staffing and coordination.

### 4. Soil and Water Quality Partnership Act

**Purpose**: Integrate soil health outcomes with water quality trading and nutrient reduction programs.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Soil and Water Quality Partnership Act."

SEC. 2. LINKED INCENTIVES.
Authorize payments and credits for soil health practices that demonstrably reduce nutrient runoff.
```

**Explanation**: Links soil outcomes to downstream water quality gains.

**Challenges**: Measurement standards and cross-agency alignment.

## State Model Legislation

States can adopt "Soil Health and Water Resilience Acts" that:

- Tie conservation incentives to soil outcome benchmarks.
- Establish equipment-sharing pools and local soil health advisers.
- Coordinate soil and water quality trading programs.

## Regulatory Framework

- USDA NRCS should publish standardized soil outcome metrics and reporting templates.
- USDA RMA should integrate soil practices into actuarial tables and premium discount models.
- EPA and USDA should align nutrient reduction and watershed metrics with soil health outcomes.

## Legal Considerations

- Data privacy: Ensure farmers control access to soil measurement data.
- Preemption: Federal baseline should allow states to set stronger standards.
- Enforcement: Require verification audits and clawbacks for false reporting.
- Sunset and review: GAO review every five years on outcomes, costs, and adoption.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Measurement gaming | Reporting improvements without verification | Medium |
| Practice-only compliance | Enrolling practices without measurable outcomes | Medium |
| Unequal access | Small and tenant farms excluded due to verification costs | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Technical assistance gaps | Slow adoption and uneven outcomes | NRCS staffing limits |
| Data fragmentation | Difficult to compare outcomes | Inconsistent metrics |
| Risk exposure | Farmers absorb transition losses | Limited insurance alignment |

### Rectification Procedures

1. Require standardized metrics and third-party verification for outcome payments.
2. Fund technical assistance and equipment-sharing pools in underserved regions.
3. Create transition insurance coverage and bridge grants for early adopters.

### General Implementation Concerns

Align federal and state programs to avoid duplicative paperwork and ensure consistent outcomes reporting.
