# Soil Health: Stakeholders

## Overview

Soil health involves a diverse array of stakeholders—from the farmers who manage 900 million acres of U.S. farmland to the downstream communities affected by water quality, from input suppliers with business models tied to current practices to environmental organizations advocating for regenerative agriculture. Understanding who is affected, who has power, and where interests align or conflict is essential for designing policies that can build coalitions and scale adoption.
