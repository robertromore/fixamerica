# Soil Health: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Transforming U.S. agricultural soil health requires a phased, multi-year strategy that builds technical assistance capacity, aligns risk management with soil-building practices, scales federal programs, develops market incentives, and institutionalizes outcome-based approaches. This roadmap sequences reforms to build on early successes, demonstrate results, and create political momentum for sustained investment. The timeline reflects the reality that soil building is a multi-year process requiring patient, sustained support.

## Strategic Approach

### Core Strategy

| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Lead with technical assistance** | Build farmer support capacity before scaling payments |
| **Reduce transition risk first** | Address insurance and revenue concerns to enable adoption |
| **Demonstrate outcomes** | Generate data showing soil health benefits for programs and markets |
| **Build bipartisan support** | Frame soil health around resilience, water quality, and profitability |
| **Scale proven approaches** | Expand pilots that work; adjust or abandon those that don't |
| **Ensure equity** | Build access for underserved producers from the start |

### Key Assumptions

| Assumption | Basis |
|------------|-------|
| **Farm bill reauthorization** | Conservation title provides primary funding vehicle |
| **IRA implementation continues** | Climate-smart conservation funding remains available |
| **State partnership** | States provide matching funds and implementation capacity |
