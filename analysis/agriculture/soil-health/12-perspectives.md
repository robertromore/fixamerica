## High-Level Takeaways

- Broad agreement that soil health underpins productivity and resilience, but disagreement centers on data requirements, mandates, and federal oversight.
- Outcome-based payments and regional technical assistance draw the widest cross-perspective support.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Outcomes Payments with Privacy Guardrails

- **Bridges**: Conservative, Centrist, Liberal
- **Core agreement**: Pay for verified outcomes while protecting farm data.
- **Policy**: Standard metrics, opt-in data sharing, and third-party verification funds.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept voluntary entry; conservatives accept federal payments.
- **Viability**: High; aligns with accountability and privacy.

### Compromise 2: Insurance Incentives with Pilot Guardrails

- **Bridges**: Centrist, Conservative, Liberal
- **Core agreement**: Reduce transition risk through insurance alignment.
- **Policy**: Pilot premium discounts with evaluation triggers and sunset clauses.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept pilots; skeptics accept limited incentives.
- **Viability**: Medium-high; depends on actuarial evidence.

### Compromise 3: Regional Hubs with State Leadership

- **Bridges**: Constitutionalist, Progressive, Populist
- **Core agreement**: Expand technical assistance and equipment access.
- **Policy**: State-led hubs with federal funding and local advisory boards.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept state control; conservatives accept funding.
- **Viability**: High; strong delivery consensus.

## Strategic Implications

- Most viable coalition centers on regional hubs and outcomes-based incentives with privacy safeguards.
- Key obstacle is verification cost and skepticism about market-based measurement.
- Bad-faith risk appears limited; focus on pilots, transparency, and farmer choice.
- Recommended approach: launch hubs and outcomes pilots first, then scale insurance alignment and water linkages.
