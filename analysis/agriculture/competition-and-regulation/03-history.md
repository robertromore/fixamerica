# Competition & Regulation: History

## Overview

The history of agricultural competition and regulation in America reveals a century-long tension between concentrated economic power and efforts to protect farmers and consumers. From the trust-busting era through modern mega-mergers, enforcement has oscillated between aggressive intervention and regulatory retreat.

## The Trust Era and Early Regulation (1890-1920)

### The Meatpacking Trusts

**The Problem**

- By 1900, five companies controlled ~45% of meatpacking
- The "Big Five": Swift, Armour, Morris, Wilson, Cudahy
- Coordinated pricing, controlled stockyards, squeezed farmers and retailers
- Upton Sinclair's *The Jungle* (1906) exposed conditions

**Early Responses**

| Year | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1890 | Sherman Antitrust Act | General antimonopoly law |
| 1906 | Meat Inspection Act | Food safety regulation |
| 1914 | Clayton Act | Strengthened antitrust |
| 1914 | Federal Trade Commission Act | Created FTC |

### The Packers and Stockyards Act (1921)

**Why It Passed**

- FTC investigation (1918-1920) documented meatpacker abuses
- Farmers facing post-WWI price collapse
- Public outrage over price manipulation
- Progressive Era momentum for regulation

**What It Did**

- Prohibited unfair, deceptive, and discriminatory practices
- Required registration of packers, stockyards, market agencies
- Gave USDA enforcement authority
- Established specific rules for livestock markets

**Structure Created**

- Packers and Stockyards Administration (within USDA)
- Federal supervision of stockyards
- Prohibition on packers owning retail outlets (later weakened)
- Bond requirements for market participants

## New Deal and Wartime Expansion (1930s-1950s)

### Agricultural Adjustment

**Depression-Era Changes**

- Agricultural Adjustment Act (1933) controlled supply
- Farm Credit System expanded
- Commodity programs created floor prices
- Regulation focused on production, not competition

**Wartime Consolidation**

| Era | Trend | Impact |
|-----|-------|--------|
| WWII | Government contracts favored large operations | Efficiency prioritized |
| Post-WWII | Technological change accelerated consolidation | Mechanization required scale |
| 1950s | Vertical integration began in poultry | New contracting model emerged |

### Poultry Integration Model

**How It Developed**

- Integrators (like Perdue, Tyson) pioneered vertical control
- Provided chicks, feed, veterinary services
- Farmers contracted to grow birds, owned facilities
- Model later spread to hogs, cattle feeding

**Consequences**

- Farmers became contractors, not independent operators
- Risk shifted to growers
- Integrators controlled genetics, inputs, processing
- Model proved highly efficient but concentrated power

## Deregulation Era (1970s-1990s)

### Shift in Antitrust Philosophy

**The Chicago School Influence**

| Period | Enforcement Philosophy |
|--------|----------------------|
| 1960s-70s | Structural concerns, market share limits |
| 1980s-90s | Consumer welfare standard, efficiency focus |
| Result | Mergers approved if prices didn't rise |

**Key Changes**

- Reagan administration relaxed merger enforcement
- Consumer price became primary antitrust metric
- Producer harms, rural impacts largely ignored
- Agricultural exemptions from some antitrust rules

### Agricultural Deregulation

**Freedom to Farm Act (1996)**

- Phased out supply management
- Moved to decoupled payments
- Increased market orientation
- Accelerated consolidation pressure

**Regulatory Retreat**

| Area | Change | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| Merger review | DOJ/FTC approved more deals | Concentration increased |
| Packers and Stockyards | Enforcement weakened | Fewer successful cases |
| State regulation | Federal preemption expanded | States limited |

### Major Consolidation Waves

**Meatpacking (1980s-2000s)**

| Year | Event | Result |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1981 | Cargill acquires MBPXL | Created largest packer |
| 1987 | ConAgra acquires Swift | Further consolidation |
| 2001 | Tyson acquires IBP | Created dominant firm |
| 2013 | JBS acquires Pilgrims Pride | Brazilian multinational enters |

**Today's "Big Four" Beef**

- Tyson Foods
- Cargill
- JBS USA
- National Beef (Marfrig)
- Combined: ~85% of beef processing

---

## Input Market Consolidation (1990s-2020s)

### Seed and Chemical Mergers

**The "Big Six" Becomes "Big Four"**

| Year | Merger | Outcome |
|------|--------|---------|
| 2015 | Dow-DuPont announced | Approved with divestitures |
| 2016 | Bayer-Monsanto announced | Approved 2018 after divestitures |
| 2017 | ChemChina-Syngenta | Approved with conditions |
| 2018 | Corteva spins off from DowDuPont | Created third major |

**Market Share Today**

| Product | Top 4 Share |
|---------|-------------|
| Corn seed | ~85% |
| Soybean seed | ~75% |
| Cotton seed | ~90% |
| Crop chemicals | ~65% |

### Farm Equipment Consolidation

**Major Players**

- John Deere (Deere & Company) - dominant
- CNH Industrial (Case IH, New Holland)
- AGCO (Massey Ferguson, Fendt)

**Issues**

- Right-to-repair restrictions
- Proprietary software locks
- Parts availability
- Dealer network requirements

## Modern Enforcement Revival (2010s-Present)

### Obama Administration Initiatives

**2010-2012 Workshops**

- DOJ-USDA joint workshops on competition
- Gathered farmer testimony across country
- Documented contract abuses, retaliatory practices
- Generated momentum for reform

**GIPSA Rule Attempt**

| Year | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 2010 | USDA proposed comprehensive rule | Strengthened P&S Act |
| 2011-2016 | Industry opposition, congressional riders | Rule weakened |
| 2017 | Most provisions withdrawn | Reform stalled |

### Trump Administration

**Modest Activity**

- Some P&S enforcement continued
- Merger review followed precedent
- No major competition initiatives
- Industry-friendly regulatory approach

### Biden Administration Revival

**Executive Order on Competition (2021)**

- Directed agencies to address agricultural concentration
- USDA tasked with strengthening P&S enforcement
- DOJ created Agriculture and Food Competition Task Force
- FTC directed to scrutinize food industry practices

**Key Actions**

| Agency | Action | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| USDA | New unfair practices rules (2022, 2024) | Partially implemented |
| DOJ | Poultry industry investigation | Ongoing |
| FTC | Grocery merger scrutiny | Kroger-Albertsons challenged |
| States | Increased coordination | Task forces formed |

**COVID-19 Impact**

- Pandemic exposed supply chain fragility
- Processing plant outbreaks shut capacity
- Cattle backed up on farms, prices plummeted
- Consumer prices spiked despite low farm prices
- "Beef spread" reached record levels

## Packers and Stockyards Act Evolution

### Major Amendments and Rules

| Year | Development | Significance |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 1958 | Extended to poultry | Covered growing sector |
| 1976 | Extended to swine contractors | Addressed integration |
| 2008 | Farm Bill provisions | Required rulemaking |
| 2016 | Final rule withdrawn | Reform blocked |
| 2022 | New unfair practices rule | Strengthened protections |
| 2024 | Tournament system rules | Addressed poultry contracts |

### Enforcement Challenges

**Structural Limitations**

- Farmers fear retaliation for complaints
- Proving unfair practices difficult
- Limited agency resources
- Industry legal challenges

**Case Law Limitations**

- *London v. Fieldale Farms* (11th Cir. 2005) - required competitive injury
- *Terry v. Tyson Farms* (5th Cir. 2010) - narrow liability
- 2022 rules attempted to reverse these interpretations

---

## State-Level Responses

### Historical State Regulation

- Many states had anti-corporate farming laws
- "Family farm" protection statutes
- State antitrust enforcement

### Modern State Action

| State | Action | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Minnesota | Corporate farm law enforcement | Ownership restrictions |
| Nebraska | Initiative 300 (later overturned) | Anti-corporate farming |
| Iowa | Contract disclosure requirements | Transparency |
| California | Prop 12 animal welfare | Production standards |

## Lessons from History

### What Has Worked

1. **Clear statutory authority** - P&S Act gave USDA specific enforcement tools
2. **Multi-agency coordination** - DOJ-USDA collaboration more effective
3. **Public pressure** - Investigations followed public outrage (1918, 2010, 2021)
4. **State action** - States can address issues federal agencies miss

### What Has Not Worked

1. **Voluntary approaches** - Industry self-regulation failed repeatedly
2. **Consumer welfare standard alone** - Ignores producer and community harms
3. **Underfunded enforcement** - Agencies lack resources to pursue complex cases
4. **Post-hoc merger review** - Breaking up completed mergers nearly impossible

### Recurring Patterns

| Pattern | Historical Examples |
|---------|---------------------|
| Crisis → reform → rollback | 1920s, 2008-2016, 2020s |
| Technology enables consolidation | Refrigeration, trucks, genetics, data |
| Regional economies suffer | Company towns, plant closures |
| Farmers lack countervailing power | Cooperatives weakened, contracts atomize |
