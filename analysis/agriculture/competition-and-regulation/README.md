# Competition & Regulation: Overview

Agricultural competition and regulation addresses the market structures, legal frameworks, and enforcement mechanisms that determine whether farmers receive fair prices, consumers have affordable choices, and rural communities maintain economic viability. Over the past four decades, unprecedented consolidation has transformed American agriculture from a sector of competitive markets to one dominated by a handful of vertically integrated corporations at every level of the supply chain—from seeds and inputs to processing, distribution, and retail.
