# Competition & Regulation: Solutions

## Overview

Restoring competitive agricultural markets requires a comprehensive strategy that combines aggressive enforcement of existing law, new legal authorities where needed, investment in competitive alternatives, transparency requirements that enable market function, and protection for farmers who face retaliation. No single intervention will reverse decades of consolidation, but coordinated action across multiple fronts can shift the trajectory toward more competitive, resilient, and equitable markets.

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Fair markets** | Farmers and ranchers should face competitive buyers, not oligopsonies |
| **Transparency** | Market participants need price and contract information to make decisions |
| **Accountability** | Corporations that violate law should face meaningful consequences |
| **Alternatives** | Farmers need viable options; support regional processing and marketing |
| **Protection** | Whistleblowers and complainants must be shielded from retaliation |
| **Coordination** | Federal, state, and local enforcement should reinforce each other |
| **Evidence-based** | Intervention should target demonstrated harms, not hypothetical concerns |

### Strategic Framework

| Strategy | Components |
|----------|------------|
| **Enforce existing law** | Revitalize Packers and Stockyards Act; vigorous antitrust enforcement |
| **Strengthen legal framework** | Close loopholes; enhance penalties; protect collective action |
| **Build alternatives** | Regional processing investment; farmer-owned infrastructure |
| **Mandate transparency** | Cash market requirements; contract disclosure; price reporting |
| **Protect producers** | Anti-retaliation rules; dispute resolution; legal assistance |
| **Coordinate agencies** | Unified data; cross-agency task forces; state partnerships |
