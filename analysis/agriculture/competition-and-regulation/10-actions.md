## For Agricultural Producers

### Protecting Yourself in Contracts

**Before Signing**

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Get it in writing | Never accept verbal promises |
| Review carefully | Take time, don't sign under pressure |
| Seek legal review | Contact FLAG or RAFI-USA for assistance |
| Compare terms | Talk to other producers when possible |
| Document everything | Keep copies of all communications |

**Key Contract Terms to Watch**

- **Arbitration clauses**: May limit legal recourse
- **Confidentiality provisions**: May prevent you from sharing information
- **Termination terms**: What triggers contract loss?
- **Performance standards**: How are you ranked/evaluated?
- **Capital requirements**: What investments are mandatory?

**Red Flags**

- Pressure to sign quickly
- Discouragement from seeking legal advice
- Vague performance metrics
- Unlimited integrator discretion
- Retaliatory termination history

### Filing Complaints

|------|---------|
| Gather documentation | Contracts, communications, financial records |
| Contact P&S Division | Online form or regional office |
| Describe specific violations | Unfair practices, deceptive conduct |
| Request confidentiality | Protection available but limited |
| Follow up | Cases can take months |

**What Constitutes a Violation**

- Unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive practices
- Retaliatory actions against complainants
- Manipulation of prices or supplies
- Fraudulent weighing or grading
- Contract terms that violate regulations

**Limitations**

## For Rural Communities

### Understanding Local Impacts

**Economic Assessment**

| Factor | Questions to Ask |
|--------|------------------|
| Employment | How many jobs depend on processing facilities? |

**Community Vulnerability**

**Economic Development Strategies**

- Diversify local economy beyond single processor
- Develop local food systems and direct marketing
- Support small business development
- Invest in workforce training

### Engaging Local Government

**Municipal and County Actions**

| Action | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Economic diversification planning | Reduce dependency |
| Zoning for small-scale processing | Enable alternatives |
