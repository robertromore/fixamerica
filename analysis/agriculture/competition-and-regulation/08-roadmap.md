# Competition & Regulation: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Restoring competitive agricultural markets requires sustained effort over multiple years, combining administrative action using existing authorities with legislative reforms and infrastructure investment. This roadmap prioritizes actions that can begin immediately while building toward more fundamental structural changes. Success depends on coordinating federal agencies, partnering with states, building coalitions, and maintaining political momentum across election cycles.

---

## Strategic Approach

### Theory of Change

| Challenge | Strategy | Outcome |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Concentrated market power** | Enforce law + build alternatives | Farmers have competitive options |
| **Weak enforcement** | Resources + coordination + political will | Meaningful deterrence |
| **Information asymmetry** | Transparency mandates + data systems | Informed market participants |
| **Producer vulnerability** | Legal protection + collective action | Farmer voice and power |
| **Regulatory capture** | Civil society oversight + accountability | Public interest prioritized |

### Sequencing Logic

1. **Use existing authority first**: Administrative actions don't require Congress
2. **Build momentum**: Early wins create political space for harder reforms
3. **Create alternatives**: Investment in regional processing reduces dependence on concentrated firms
4. **Strengthen legal framework**: Codify effective reforms; close loopholes
5. **Institutionalize**: Embed reforms in ongoing programs and oversight

### Political Strategy

| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Coalition building** | Farmers + consumers + rural communities + labor |
| **Bipartisan framing** | Rural economic development; fair markets; food security |
| **State partnerships** | Leverage state attorneys general and agriculture departments |
| **Industry pressure** | Public campaigns; investor engagement; procurement leverage |
| **Election timing** | Front-load administrative action; position legislative reforms |
