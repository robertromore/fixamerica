# Competition and Regulation: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative framework for agricultural competition aims to reverse decades of consolidation that has left farmers with fewer buyers for their goods and higher costs for their inputs. The approach focuses on reinvigorating antitrust enforcement, ensuring fair contracts for producers, and restoring the right to repair farm equipment.

Current policy relies on the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, which has been weakened by court interpretations and lack of enforcement. The proposed legislation modernizes this framework, creates dedicated enforcement mechanisms within the USDA, and addresses new forms of market power such as the "tournament system" in poultry and software locks on tractors. The strategy combines structural remedies (breaking up monopolies) with conduct remedies (banning unfair practices) to level the playing field for independent family farms.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for agricultural competition reform. Congress has broad authority under the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) to regulate interstate markets, prohibit unfair trade practices, and establish standards for equipment repair.*

---

## Federal Legislation

### The Agricultural Competition and Enforcement Act

**Purpose**: To strengthen the Packers and Stockyards Act, establish a dedicated Office of the Special Investigator for Competition Matters, and reverse the burden of proof regarding competitive injury.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Office of the Special Investigator**: Creates a Senate-confirmed position within USDA with subpoena power to investigate antitrust violations.
2. **Clarification of Competitive Injury**: Amends the Packers and Stockyards Act to clarify that a producer does not need to prove injury to the entire sector to win a claim of unfair practice.
3. **Merger Moratorium**: Imposes a temporary moratorium on large agribusiness mergers to allow for a comprehensive review of market concentration.
4. **Spot Market Protection**: Requires large meatpackers to purchase a minimum percentage of livestock through open, transparent spot markets rather than captive supply arrangements.
5. **Whistleblower Protections**: Strengthens protections for farmers and industry employees who report anti-competitive behavior.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To strengthen enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, to prohibit anti-competitive practices in the agricultural supply chain, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Agricultural Competition and Enforcement Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The four largest beef packers control 85 percent of the market, the four largest pork packers control 70 percent, and the four largest poultry processors control 54 percent (USDA, 2023).
(2) This concentration has led to a decline in the farmer's share of the retail food dollar, which has fallen from 50 cents in 1952 to less than 15 cents today (National Farmers Union).
(3) Courts have interpreted the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 to require proof of harm to competition across the entire sector, making it nearly impossible for individual farmers to seek redress for unfair practices.
(4) A dedicated enforcement office is necessary to investigate complex anti-competitive schemes in the agricultural sector.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) SECRETARY.—The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Agriculture.
(2) PACKER.—The term "packer" has the meaning given the term in section 201 of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 (7 U.S.C. 191).
(3) SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR.—The term "Special Investigator" means the Special Investigator for Competition Matters established under section 4.

SEC. 4. OFFICE OF THE SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established within the Department of Agriculture the Office of the Special Investigator for Competition Matters.
(b) APPOINTMENT.—The Office shall be headed by a Special Investigator, who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.
(c) DUTIES.—The Special Investigator shall—
    (1) use all available authority, including subpoena power, to investigate and prosecute violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921;
    (2) serve as a liaison to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission; and
    (3) maintain a hotline for reporting anti-competitive practices.

SEC. 5. CLARIFICATION OF COMPETITIVE INJURY.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 202 of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 (7 U.S.C. 192) is amended by adding at the end the following:
"(c) PROOF OF INJURY.—In any action for a violation of this section, a plaintiff shall not be required to prove that the violation caused an injury to competition in the entire sector or market. Proof of injury to the individual plaintiff or a specific group of producers shall be sufficient."

SEC. 6. SPOT MARKET REQUIREMENT.

(a) REQUIREMENT.—A covered packer shall purchase not less than 50 percent of its weekly volume of livestock through spot market sales.
(b) DEFINITION.—For purposes of this section, "spot market sale" means a purchase and sale of livestock where the price is determined by firm interaction between buyer and seller on the day of the transaction.
(c) NON-AFFILIATED.—Spot market sales must be between non-affiliated parties.

SEC. 7. MERGER MORATORIUM.

(a) PROHIBITION.—For a period of 18 months beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, no covered agribusiness with annual revenue exceeding $100,000,000 shall acquire, directly or indirectly, any voting securities or assets of another agribusiness.
(b) STUDY.—During the moratorium, the Comptroller General shall conduct a study on the impact of concentration in the agricultural sector on food prices and farm income.

SEC. 8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) ANNUAL REPORT.—The Special Investigator shall submit to Congress an annual report detailing—
    (1) the number of investigations opened and closed;
    (2) the nature of violations found; and
    (3) recommendations for further legislative action.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $55,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $60,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $65,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $70,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Gives the USDA "teeth" by creating a prosecutor specifically focused on ag antitrust, independent of the political pressures on the Secretary.
- **Section 5**: Overturns court precedents (like *Pickett v. Tyson Fresh Meats*) that neutered the P&S Act, restoring the ability of farmers to sue for unfair treatment.
- **Section 6**: Forces price discovery by requiring open market purchases, preventing packers from using captive supplies to manipulate prices downward.
- **Section 7**: Hits the "pause" button on consolidation to prevent the situation from worsening while new rules are implemented.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Nominate Special Investigator | 60 days after enactment | President |
| Issue guidance on "Competitive Injury" | 180 days after enactment | USDA / DOJ |
| Spot Market Rules Finalized | 1 year after enactment | USDA AMS |
| Merger Moratorium Expires | 18 months after enactment | Congress/FTC |

**Challenges**:

- **Litigation**: Meatpackers will almost certainly challenge the "spot market" requirement as a violation of freedom of contract.
- **Coordination**: Ensuring the Special Investigator doesn't conflict with DOJ Antitrust Division jurisdiction.

**Refinements**:

- Include a "safe harbor" for small cooperatives to merge during the moratorium.
- Define "spot market" rigorously to prevent "sweetheart deals" from counting toward the quota.

### The Fairness for Contract Growers Act

**Purpose**: To reform the poultry and livestock contracting system by banning the "tournament system" of payment and requiring full transparency in grower contracts.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Tournament System Ban**: Prohibits payment systems where growers' compensation is based on their performance relative to other growers (a zero-sum game).
2. **Base Pay Guarantee**: Mandates a guaranteed base pay that covers the cost of production.
3. **Disclosure Requirements**: Requires integrators to disclose the quality of inputs (chicks, feed) provided to growers.
4. **Capital Investment Protection**: Prevents integrators from requiring additional capital investments (e.g., new chicken house upgrades) unless they provide a corresponding increase in pay to cover the cost.
5. **Right to Cancel**: Grants growers a 3-day right to cancel contracts after review.

**Draft Text**:

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To protect poultry and livestock growers from unfair and deceptive practices in the contracting system.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Fairness for Contract Growers Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Over 90 percent of chicken farmers are paid under a "tournament system" where their pay is determined by ranking against neighbors (USDA).
(2) Integrators control the quality of inputs (chicks and feed), which determines grower performance, creating an opportunity for manipulation.
(3) Many contract growers live below the poverty line despite investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in infrastructure.
(4) Transparency in contracting is essential for a fair agricultural market.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) INTEGRATOR.—The term "integrator" means a packer or processor that contracts with growers to raise livestock or poultry.
(2) TOURNAMENT SYSTEM.—The term "tournament system" means a payment arrangement in which a grower's compensation is adjusted based on their performance ranking relative to other growers.

SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON TOURNAMENT SYSTEMS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—It shall be unlawful for any integrator to use a tournament system to determine the compensation of a contract grower.
(b) PERMISSIBLE INCENTIVES.—Integrators may offer performance incentives based on objective, fixed standards (e.g., feed conversion ratio) provided that such standards are disclosed in advance and are not based on relative ranking.

SEC. 5. DISCLOSURE AND TRANSPARENCY.

(a) INPUT DISCLOSURE.—With each delivery of chicks or feed, the integrator shall provide the grower with a written disclosure of the breed, age, and health status of the animals, and the nutritional content of the feed.
(b) STATISTICAL INFORMATION.—Integrators shall provide growers with statistical information on the performance of all growers in their complex, anonymized to protect privacy.

SEC. 6. CAPITAL INVESTMENT STANDARDS.

(a) REQUIREMENT.—An integrator may not require a grower to make additional capital investments in facilities during the term of a contract unless the integrator provides additional compensation sufficient to cover the cost of the investment over its useful life.
(b) RECOUPMENT.—If an integrator terminates a contract without cause, the integrator shall pay the grower the remaining value of any required capital investments.

SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) USDA AUDIT.—The Secretary shall conduct annual audits of integrator compliance with disclosure rules.
(b) GROWER COMPLAINTS.—The Secretary shall report annually on the number and nature of grower complaints regarding contract violations.

SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $32,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $34,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $36,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $38,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Eliminates the "hunger games" aspect of poultry farming where one farmer's bonus comes out of another's paycheck, replacing it with fixed performance standards.
- **Section 5**: Prevents integrators from punishing disfavored growers by sending them sick chicks or bad feed, a common retaliation tactic.
- **Section 6**: Stops the "treadmill of debt" where growers are forced to upgrade barns constantly, keeping them in debt and unable to leave the integrator.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Issue Final Rule on Tournaments | 180 days after enactment | USDA AMS |
| Establish Disclosure Forms | 90 days after enactment | USDA AMS |
| Begin Compliance Audits | Oct 1, 2027 | USDA AMS |

**Challenges**:

- **Industry Resistance**: Integrators will argue that tournaments promote efficiency and lower consumer prices.
- **Contract Complexity**: Writing rules that cover the myriad variations of grower contracts is difficult.

**Refinements**:

- Allow for "pilot programs" of alternative pay structures under USDA supervision.

### The Agricultural Right to Repair Act

**Purpose**: To guarantee farmers the right to repair their own equipment (tractors, combines) by requiring manufacturers to make diagnostic tools, software, and manuals available on fair terms.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Requirement to Provide**: Mandates original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to provide owners and independent repair shops with the same documentation, parts, and tools available to authorized dealers.
2. **Software Access**: Specifically requires access to embedded software and firmware necessary for repair and maintenance.
3. **Fair Pricing**: Tools and documentation must be provided at fair and reasonable costs.
4. **Prohibition on Locks**: Bans the use of digital locks (TPMs) that prevent diagnosis or repair.
5. **Enforcement**: Authorizes the FTC to enforce these provisions as unfair trade practices.

**Draft Text**:

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To require original equipment manufacturers of agricultural equipment to make diagnostic and repair information available to owners and independent repair providers.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Agricultural Right to Repair Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Modern agricultural equipment is increasingly reliant on software and digital systems.
(2) Manufacturers often restrict access to diagnostic tools, forcing farmers to rely on authorized dealers, which can lead to delays during critical harvest windows.
(3) A farmer's inability to repair their own property undermines property rights and increases input costs.
(4) Competition in the repair market lowers costs and improves service.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT.—The term "agricultural equipment" means equipment that is designed for use in the production of agricultural products.
(2) OEM.—The term "OEM" means original equipment manufacturer.
(3) FAIR AND REASONABLE TERMS.—The term "fair and reasonable terms" means at costs and terms that are equivalent to the most favorable costs and terms offered to authorized repair providers.

SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS FOR MANUFACTURERS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—An OEM shall make available to any owner of agricultural equipment or independent repair provider, on fair and reasonable terms, any documentation, part, software, or tool required to diagnose, maintain, or repair the equipment.
(b) SOFTWARE.—For equipment that contains an electronic security lock or other security-related function, the OEM shall make available to the owner or independent repair provider any special documentation, tool, or part needed to reset the lock or function.
(c) NO WAIVER.—An OEM may not require an owner to waive their rights under this Act as a condition of purchase.

SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT.

(a) UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE ACT.—A violation of this Act shall be treated as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or practice prescribed under section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act.
(b) ACTIONS BY FTC.—The Federal Trade Commission shall enforce this Act in the same manner, by the same means, and with the same jurisdiction as though all applicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act were incorporated into and made a part of this Act.
(c) STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL.—In any case in which the attorney general of a State has reason to believe that an interest of the residents of that State has been threatened or adversely affected by a violation of this Act, the attorney general may bring a civil action.

SEC. 6. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) FTC REPORT.—Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the FTC shall submit a report to Congress on the effectiveness of this Act in promoting competition in the repair market.

SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to the Federal Trade Commission to carry out this Act—
    (1) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Breaks the monopoly that manufacturers hold over the repair process, ensuring that a farmer owns their tractor in practice, not just in name.
- **Section 5**: Leverages the FTC's broad consumer protection powers to police compliance, rather than relying solely on the USDA.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Issue Guidance to OEMs | 90 days after enactment | FTC |
| Compliance Deadline | Jan 1, 2027 | OEMs |
| First Enforcement Actions | 2027 | FTC / State AGs |

**Challenges**:

- **Cybersecurity**: OEMs argue that open access creates vulnerabilities to hacking or modification of emissions controls.
- **IP Rights**: Manufacturers claim that software code is proprietary intellectual property.

**Refinements**:

- Explicitly exclude modifications that violate the Clean Air Act (emissions tampering) to address environmental concerns.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Agricultural Fair Repair Act

**Purpose**: To establish a state-level right to repair for agricultural equipment, providing immediate relief while federal legislation is pending.

**Adaptability Notes**: States with strong agricultural lobbies may face intense opposition; framing this as "property rights" is crucial.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Agricultural Fair Repair Act".

SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS.
(a) "Authorized repair provider" means an individual or business who has an arrangement with the original equipment manufacturer...
(b) "Fair and reasonable terms" means...

SECTION 3. REQUIREMENTS.
(a) Manufacturers of agricultural equipment sold or used in this State shall make available to any independent repair provider or owner of agricultural equipment manufactured by or on behalf of, or sold by, the manufacturer, on fair and reasonable terms, documentation, parts, and tools, inclusive of any updates to information or embedded software.

SECTION 4. ENFORCEMENT.
(a) The Attorney General may bring an action in the name of the State...
(b) Any person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property... may bring an action...

SECTION 5. LIMITATIONS.
(a) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to require an original equipment manufacturer to divulge a trade secret.
(b) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to allow for the modification of equipment in a manner that deactivates safety or emissions control systems.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3**: Mirrors the federal proposal but applies it to commerce within the state.
- **Section 5**: Pre-emptively addresses the "hacking" and "trade secret" arguments used by opposition lobbyists.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division.

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Undue Preference Rule**: Define exactly what constitutes "undue preference" under the P&S Act. Deadline: 1 year.
2. **Poultry Grower Ranking Systems**: Regulations specifying prohibited payment practices.
3. **Product of USA Labeling**: Finalize rules on what qualifies for voluntary origin labeling to support competition.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: Up to $29,000 per violation per day for P&S Act violations.
- **Administrative Actions**: Cease and desist orders; suspension of packer registration.
- **Private Right of Action**: Restored and clarified by the proposed legislation.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause**: Federal regulation of livestock markets is well-established (*Stafford v. Wallace*, 1922).
**Takings Clause**: Right to Repair laws must avoid constituting a taking of trade secrets. The legislation includes savings clauses for trade secrets to mitigate this risk.

### Preemption

The Packers and Stockyards Act generally does not preempt state laws that provide *greater* protection to farmers. The proposed legislation should explicitly state that it sets a floor, not a ceiling.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance relies on whistleblower reports and data analysis. The new Office of the Special Investigator will need robust data analytics capabilities to detect price fixing in spot markets.

---

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **"Forward Contract" Exemption** | Packers shift volume to forward contracts to evade spot market minimums. | High | Include forward contracts with <14 day delivery in "spot market" definition. |
| **Affiliate Sales** | Packers sell to subsidiaries to manipulate reported prices. | Medium | Ban affiliate transactions from counting toward spot market quotas. |
| **Trade Secret Claims** | OEMs claim diagnostic codes are trade secrets to deny access. | High | Statutorily define diagnostic info as non-trade-secret. |
| **"Quality" Bonuses** | Integrators use subjective "quality" metrics to reintroduce tournaments. | Medium | Require all bonuses to be based on objective, measurable standards. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Global Markets** | Domestic rules don't affect global consolidation. | International trade. | Coordinate antitrust actions with EU/other allies. |
| **Alternative Buyers** | Breaking up packers doesn't guarantee new buyers appear immediately. | High barriers to entry. | Grants for new independent processing capacity. |
| **Litigation Delays** | Industry will tie up rules in court for years. | Judicial review. | Congress must write explicit, non-ambiguous statutes to limit judicial interpretation. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Define "Spot Market"**: Amend Section 6 to explicitly include short-term forward contracts.
2. **Trade Secret Carve-out**: Amend Right to Repair Act to explicitly state that interoperability information is not a trade secret.
3. **Judicial Review**: Limit venue for challenges to the D.C. Circuit to prevent forum shopping.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **Merger Moratorium**: Sunsets after 18 months.
- **Program Review**: GAO review of the Special Investigator office after 3 years.
