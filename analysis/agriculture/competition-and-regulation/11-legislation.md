# Competition & Regulation: Legislation

## Overview

Strengthening competition in agriculture requires a legislative package that improves data visibility, supports regional processors, and protects farmers during contracting. This statute package blends new enforcement authority with funding to lower barriers for small and mid-size processors and ensures federal oversight collaborates with states.

## Model Federal Bills

### 1. Agricultural Competition Transparency and Enforcement Act

**Purpose**: Establish the USDA–DOJ–FTC data hub, require standardized reporting of contract terms, and expand merger review criteria to include rural economic resilience.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Agricultural Competition Transparency and Enforcement Act."

SEC. 2. DATA HUB.
The Secretary of Agriculture shall establish the Agricultural Competition Data Hub in coordination with the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission to collect standardized procurement, contract deduction, and throughput data from processors that control more than 5% of a domestic supply chain segment.

SEC. 3. MERGER REVIEW.
The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice shall include rural employment effects and regional processing capacity in their substantial lessening of competition analysis.
```

**Explanation**: Aligns enforcement with real-time data to identify harmful concentration and targets the highest 5% of processors for disclosure, balancing burden with oversight.

**Challenges**: Building interoperable IT and safeguarding sensitive business information.

### 2. Regional Processor Resilience Act

**Purpose**: Create a grant/loan fund to help cooperative or independent processors upgrade technology, meet reporting requirements, and expand worker protections.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Regional Processor Resilience Act."

SEC. 2. FUND.
The Secretary shall establish the Regional Processor Resilience Fund to award capital and technical assistance to processors that commit to transparent reporting, worker safety standards, and stable purchasing from independent producers.

SEC. 3. PRIORITY.
Priority is given to projects that diversify ownership, serve underserved regions, and partner with legal clinics to support farmers.
```

**Explanation**: Links funding to transparency and worker standards so the fund does not reinforce incumbents and mitigates job concerns over enforcement.

**Challenges**: Guarding against capture by larger firms and ensuring geographic distribution.

### 3. Producer Contract Fairness Act

**Purpose**: Codify protections requiring clear deduction disclosures, reciprocal arbitration options, and whistleblower protections.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Producer Contract Fairness Act."

SEC. 2. CONTRACT LAW.
Processors must disclose all deductions, fees, and contingent conditions in plain-language summaries and provide producers ten business days to seek legal advice before signing.

SEC. 3. WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS.
A producer who reports unfair deductions is protected from retaliation and may file a civil action under the Packers and Stockyards Act.
```

**Explanation**: Reduces informational asymmetries and encourages producers to raise concerns without fear of retaliation.

**Challenges**: Enforcing disclosures across supply chains and ensuring producers have legal counsel.

## State Model Legislation

States can pass “Agricultural Fair Contract Acts” that extend disclosure requirements to retailers, allow state AGs to subpoena processor data, and offer matching funds for regional processors. States should coordinate with neighboring states to share data and prevent “race to the bottom” incentives.

## Regulatory Framework

- USDA Packers and Stockyards Division will issue rulemaking that defines standard deduction categories and enforces reporting.
- DOJ/FTC will convene annual merger review conferences with state AGs to align investigations and share data.
- USDA’s Office of Advocacy for Farmers shall monitor compliance and report to Congress biannually.

## Legal Considerations

- Constitutional Issues: Data hub must respect due process and protect proprietary information under the Takings Clause.
- Preemption Questions: Federal statutes should allow states to adopt stronger contracting rules without conflict.
- Enforcement Mechanisms: Civil penalties, injunctions, and private rights of action under the Packers and Stockyards Act.
- Sunset and Review Provisions: Mandatory review every five years with stakeholder input.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Data obfuscation | Processors use third-party aggregators to mask deductions and fees | High |
| Fund capture | Larger processors rebrand subsidiaries to qualify for resilience funds | Medium |
| Contracting around disclosures | Producers shift to verbal agreements or “addendums” | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Insufficient enforcement capacity | Reporting without follow-up lowers deterrence | Funding for DOJ/FTC remains static |
| Geographic inequity | Funds concentrate in Midwest grain corridor | Absence of place-based allocation formulas |
| Legal support gaps | Producers cannot interpret disclosures | Limited rural legal aid resources |

### Rectification Procedures

1. Mandate interoperability standards for data submissions so regulators can detect obfuscation.
2. Tie fund eligibility to geographic weighting and third-party audits to prevent capture.
3. Expand Legal Services Corporation grants and USDA’s legal clinic program for contract review support.

### General Implementation Concerns

Timely appropriation cycles are critical; oversight should coordinate fiscal-year budgeting with enforcement and grant disbursement.
