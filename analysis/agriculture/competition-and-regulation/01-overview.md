# Competition & Regulation: Overview

## Executive Summary

Agricultural competition and regulation addresses the market structures, legal frameworks, and enforcement mechanisms that determine whether farmers receive fair prices, consumers have affordable choices, and rural communities maintain economic viability. Over the past four decades, unprecedented consolidation has transformed American agriculture from a sector of competitive markets to one dominated by a handful of vertically integrated corporations at every level of the supply chain—from seeds and inputs to processing, distribution, and retail.

This consolidation has profound consequences: farmers face oligopsonistic buyers who suppress farmgate prices, rural communities lose processing facilities and jobs, consumers experience reduced choice and periodic price spikes, and the food system becomes vulnerable to disruption when any single node fails. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed these vulnerabilities dramatically when meatpacking plant closures created simultaneous shortages and price spikes while farmers euthanized animals they could not sell.

Reform requires coordinated action across multiple fronts: revitalizing antitrust enforcement, mandating market transparency, protecting farmers from unfair contract practices, investing in regional processing capacity, and ensuring that the legal frameworks governing agricultural markets actually serve the interests of producers and consumers rather than the corporations that dominate them.

## Key Facts

### Market Concentration

| Sector | Concentration | Impact |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Beef packing** | Top 4 control ~85% | Cattle prices suppressed; processing bottlenecks |
| **Pork packing** | Top 4 control ~70% | Similar pattern to beef |
| **Poultry processing** | Top 4 control 50-70% | Vertically integrated; grower contracts |
| **Seed/agrochemicals** | Top 4 control ~60% global | Reduced innovation; higher input costs |
| **Grain handling** | Top 4 handle ~75% | Price discovery problems; basis manipulation |
| **Grocery retail** | Top 4 control ~40% | Private label pressure; slotting fees |
| **Food service** | Top 4 distributors ~50% | Contract concentration; price setting |

### Economic Impacts

| Impact | Magnitude | Source |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Farmer revenue loss** | $15-20 billion annually | Contract deductions, suppressed prices |
| **Processing margin expansion** | Farm share of retail dollar fell from 40% to 15% since 1950 | USDA ERS |
| **Cash market decline** | Only 20-25% of cattle sold on cash markets | AMI/USDA |
| **Regional processor closures** | 50%+ of small/medium plants closed since 1980 | Census of Manufactures |

### Enforcement Capacity

| Agency | Agricultural Competition Resources |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| **DOJ Antitrust Division** | ~30 attorneys on agriculture task force |
| **FTC** | Small agriculture team; focused on retail |
| **USDA Packers & Stockyards** | Limited enforcement staff; regulatory delays |
| **State attorneys general** | Varied capacity; some active (California, Minnesota) |

## Why This Matters

### For Farmers

Agricultural producers face a fundamental market failure: they must sell their products to a small number of buyers who have immense power to set terms. This oligopsony suppresses prices, enables unfair contract practices, and leaves farmers with few alternatives when they face retaliation for speaking out. The tournament system in poultry production, where growers compete against each other and the lowest performers are cut, exemplifies how market power can be weaponized against producers.

### For Rural Communities

Processing plants have historically anchored rural economies, providing jobs and supporting local businesses. As consolidation has concentrated processing in fewer, larger facilities, many rural communities have lost their economic base. The remaining mega-plants bring their own problems: transient workforces, environmental burdens, and vulnerability to disruption that can devastate entire regions.

### For Consumers

While proponents of consolidation claim efficiency gains benefit consumers, the evidence is mixed at best. Processing margins have expanded dramatically, farm-to-retail price spreads have widened, and consumers face reduced choices. When disruptions occur—as during COVID-19—concentrated systems amplify rather than absorb shocks, leading to shortages and price spikes.

### For Food Security

A food system dependent on a handful of massive processing facilities is inherently fragile. Fires, disease outbreaks, labor disputes, or cyberattacks can disrupt significant portions of the food supply. Geographic concentration means that regional disasters have national consequences. Rebuilding distributed processing capacity is a national security imperative.

### For Democracy

Economic concentration translates into political power. The same corporations that dominate agricultural markets also dominate agricultural policy, using lobbying and campaign contributions to shape farm bills, block enforcement actions, and prevent reforms. Breaking up concentrated market power is essential for restoring democratic accountability in agricultural policy.

## Historical Context

Agricultural competition policy has a long history in America, reflecting the tension between agrarian ideals of independent farmers and the reality of concentrated economic power. The Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 was passed in response to the market power of the "Big Five" meatpackers of that era. Subsequent enforcement waxed and waned, but the fundamental problem has intensified as consolidation has accelerated since the 1980s.

The current wave of concentration began with the market orientation reforms of the 1980s and 1990s, which removed many of the supply management and price support mechanisms that had stabilized agricultural markets. Without these guardrails, aggressive consolidation became profitable, and a series of mergers transformed agriculture into one of America's most concentrated sectors.

## Path Forward

Addressing agricultural competition requires action on multiple fronts:

1. **Enforce existing law**: USDA, DOJ, and FTC have substantial authority they have not fully utilized
2. **Strengthen legal framework**: Close loopholes, enhance remedies, protect whistleblowers
3. **Build alternatives**: Invest in regional processing and farmer-owned infrastructure
4. **Require transparency**: Mandate disclosure of prices, contracts, and practices
5. **Protect collective action**: Enable farmers to bargain collectively without antitrust exposure
6. **Coordinate enforcement**: Align federal agencies and support state action
