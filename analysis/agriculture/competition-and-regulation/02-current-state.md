# Competition & Regulation: Current State

## Overview

American agricultural markets exhibit extreme concentration across virtually every segment of the supply chain. From the seeds farmers plant to the retailers who sell food to consumers, a small number of corporations dominate, extracting value while farmers receive an ever-shrinking share of the food dollar. Despite decades of consolidation and mounting evidence of competitive harm, enforcement has been sporadic and largely ineffective at reversing the trend.

## Market Concentration by Sector

### Meatpacking

| Segment | Top 4 Market Share | Major Players | Trend |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| **Beef packing** | ~85% | JBS, Tyson, Cargill, National Beef | Stable at high concentration |
| **Pork packing** | ~70% | Smithfield (WH Group), JBS, Tyson, Hormel | Increasing |
| **Poultry processing** | 50-70% | Tyson, Pilgrim's Pride (JBS), Perdue, Sanderson Farms | High with vertical integration |
| **Sheep/lamb** | >80% | JBS, Mountain States Rosen | Very concentrated |

**Key Dynamics:**

- Four companies slaughter over 80% of the nation's cattle, giving them enormous power to suppress prices paid to ranchers
- The same companies often own feedlots, creating vertical integration that further disadvantages independent ranchers
- Meatpacking plants have consolidated into fewer, larger facilities, increasing geographic concentration
- Processing capacity bottlenecks during COVID-19 revealed extreme vulnerability of concentrated system

### Seeds and Agricultural Inputs

| Segment | Top 4 Market Share | Major Players | Trend |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| **Seeds (global)** | ~60% | Bayer, Corteva, Syngenta (ChemChina), BASF | Post-merger consolidation |
| **Agrochemicals** | ~70% | Same as seeds (bundled) | Increasing |
| **Fertilizer** | ~60% | Nutrien, CF Industries, Mosaic, Koch | Oligopoly pricing |
| **Farm equipment** | ~60% | Deere, CNH, AGCO | Increasing; repair restrictions |

**Key Dynamics:**

- Mega-mergers (Bayer-Monsanto, Dow-DuPont, ChemChina-Syngenta) dramatically increased concentration
- Bundling of seeds, traits, and chemicals creates lock-in effects for farmers
- Patent protection on traits extends market power beyond traditional antitrust concerns
- Right to repair battles highlight equipment manufacturers' control over farmers

### Grain and Commodity Handling

| Segment | Top 4 Market Share | Major Players | Trend |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| **Grain merchandising** | ~75% | Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill, Louis Dreyfus | Stable oligopoly |
| **Ethanol production** | ~40% | POET, ADM, Valero, Green Plains | Moderate concentration |
| **Soybean crushing** | ~80% | ADM, Bunge, Cargill, AG Processing | High concentration |

**Key Dynamics:**

- ABCD companies (ADM, Bunge, Cargill, Louis Dreyfus) dominate global grain trade
- Basis manipulation possible due to concentrated local elevator ownership
- Farmer bargaining power limited by few marketing options

### Retail and Food Service

| Segment | Top 4 Market Share | Major Players | Trend |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| **Grocery retail** | ~40% | Walmart, Kroger, Albertsons, Costco | Increasing; proposed Kroger-Albertsons merger |
| **Food service distribution** | ~50% | Sysco, US Foods, Performance Food Group, Gordon Food Service | Concentrated |
| **Fast food** | Varies by category | McDonald's, Starbucks, Yum Brands | Supply chain consolidation |

**Key Dynamics:**

- Kroger-Albertsons merger would significantly increase grocery concentration
- Private label expansion gives retailers power over suppliers
- Slotting fees and promotional allowances extract value from suppliers
- Amazon entry has not reduced overall concentration

## Geographic Concentration

### Processing Facility Distribution

| Region | Share of Processing | Key Facilities |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Midwest** | ~50% of beef, ~60% of pork | Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota |
| **Southeast** | ~70% of poultry | Georgia, Arkansas, North Carolina |
| **High Plains** | ~30% of beef | Texas panhandle, Kansas |

**Key Issues:**

- Closure of regional processing has left many areas without local options
- Farmers must transport animals long distances to reach processing
- When major facilities close or slow, entire regions face marketing disruptions
- Rural communities lose economic anchors when processing consolidates

### State-Level Market Conditions

| State | Dominant Sector | Concentration Issues |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Iowa** | Pork, corn, soybeans | Packers, grain handlers highly concentrated |
| **Kansas** | Beef cattle | Few packing options; long transport distances |
| **Georgia** | Poultry | Vertically integrated; contract grower dependence |
| **California** | Specialty crops | Processing concentration; labor-intensive |
| **Nebraska** | Beef, corn | Packing concentration; rail consolidation |
| **North Carolina** | Poultry, hogs | Integration; environmental concentration |

## Contract and Pricing Practices

### Poultry Grower Contracts

| Practice | Description | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Tournament system** | Growers paid based on relative performance against neighbors | Pits farmers against each other; lowest performers cut |
| **Capital requirements** | Growers must finance facilities to integrator specs | $1-2 million debt with no ownership of birds |
| **Placement discretion** | Integrator controls timing and quality of chick placement | Affects grower income; potential for retaliation |
| **Contract termination** | Short-term contracts renewable at integrator discretion | Constant threat of losing livelihood |

**Current Status:**

- 97% of broiler chickens raised under contract with integrators
- Average poultry grower income: ~$35,000/year despite massive capital investment
- High rates of bankruptcy and financial distress among growers
- Growers who speak out face documented retaliation

### Cattle Marketing

| Practice | Description | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Alternative Marketing Arrangements (AMAs)** | Forward contracts, formula pricing, packer-owned cattle | Reduced cash market; price discovery problems |
| **Cash market decline** | Only 20-25% of cattle sold on open cash markets | Thin markets; price manipulation risk |
| **Captive supply** | Packers own or control cattle before purchase | Reduces competition for independent cattle |

**Current Status:**

- Cattle ranchers argue AMAs suppress prices by $50-100+ per head
- Mandatory price reporting has gaps and delays
- Regional variation in cash market availability creates inequities

## Enforcement Landscape

### Federal Agency Activity

| Agency | Recent Actions | Resources |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **DOJ Antitrust Division** | Agriculture task force investigating poultry, beef; some indictments | ~30 dedicated attorneys |
| **FTC** | Grocery retail focus; merger review | Limited agriculture team |
| **USDA Packers & Stockyards** | Proposed rules on unfair practices; retaliation protection | Understaffed; regulatory delays |

**Recent Enforcement:**

- **Poultry price-fixing**: DOJ secured guilty pleas from some executives; others acquitted
- **Beef price-fixing investigations**: Ongoing; rancher lawsuits pending
- **Proposed USDA rules**: Modernizing Packers and Stockyards Act regulations (delayed/contested)

### State-Level Activity

| State | Actions | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **California** | AB 1066 transparency; agricultural labor protections | Implemented |
| **Minnesota** | Packer disclosure requirements | Enacted |
| **Colorado** | Meat processing development | Investment programs |
| **Several states** | Right to repair laws affecting farm equipment | Varied progress |
