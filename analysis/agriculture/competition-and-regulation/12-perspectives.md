## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Tiered Reporting + State Partnership

- **Bridges**: Conservative, Centrist, Liberal, Populist
- **Core agreement**: Transparency for dominant processors with reduced burden on smaller firms.
- **Policy**: Set a high reporting threshold (top 5% capacity) and allow states to co-administer audits; publish aggregate data only.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept limited scope; conservatives accept federal standards tied to state enforcement.
- **Viability**: High; coalition includes centrist and populist buy-in.

### Compromise 2: Regional Fund with Anti-Capture Guardrails

- **Bridges**: Populist, Religious Right, Centrist, Liberal, Conservative
- **Core agreement**: Invest in local processing while preventing incumbent capture.
- **Policy**: Grants prioritized for cooperatives, new entrants, and underserved regions; mandatory third-party audits; sunset clauses.
- **Concessions**: Conservatives accept funding; progressives accept phased rollout.
- **Viability**: High; aligns with rural job creation and accountability.

### Compromise 3: Producer Contract Fairness Safe Harbor

- **Bridges**: Liberal, Centrist, Conservative, Libertarian
- **Core agreement**: Clear disclosures and whistleblower protections without heavy arbitration mandates.
- **Policy**: Plain-language disclosure rule and safe harbor for voluntary arbitration with cooling-off periods.
- **Concessions**: Reformers narrow mandates; libertarians accept disclosure requirements.
- **Viability**: Medium; depends on enforcement capacity.

## Strategic Implications

- Most viable coalition centers on transparency plus regional investment, with carefully limited mandates.
- Key obstacle is disagreement over federal scope and mandatory reporting burdens.
- Bad-faith risk appears limited; leverage broad good-faith distribution to build incremental wins.
- Recommended approach: pursue the Regional Fund first, then layer in a scoped Transparency Act tied to state partnerships.
