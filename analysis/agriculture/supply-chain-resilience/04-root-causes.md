# Supply Chain Resilience: Root Causes

## Overview

Agricultural supply chain fragility persists despite its designation as critical infrastructure because multiple interlocking systems—market concentration, infrastructure underinvestment, just-in-time optimization, and fragmented coordination—create conditions where efficiency gains mask systemic vulnerability. Understanding these root causes reveals why crisis responses alone have not built lasting resilience.

## Market Concentration Causes

### Processing Consolidation

**The Concentration Problem**

| Sector | Top 4 Market Share | Effect |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Beef packing | ~85% | Single plant failures cascade |
| Pork packing | ~70% | Limited alternative capacity |
| Poultry processing | ~55% | Integrator control |
| Grain trading | ~70% | Market power over farmers |

**Why Concentration Persists**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Economies of scale | Larger plants more efficient |
| Capital requirements | High barriers to entry |
| Regulatory compliance costs | Favor large operations |
| Buyer consolidation | Retail demands scale |

**Consolidation Consequences**

| Consequence | Impact on Resilience |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Plant closures cascade | No backup capacity nearby |
| Worker concentration | Single outbreak shuts facility |
| Transport dependence | Longer hauls required |
| Price transmission | Farmers absorb shocks |

### Retail and Distribution Concentration

**Downstream Consolidation**

| Level | Concentration | Effect |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| Grocery retail | Top 5 = 45%+ | Buyer power over suppliers |
| Foodservice distribution | Top 3 = 30%+ | Scale requirements |
| Wholesale | Consolidating | Fewer regional options |

**Procurement Practices**

| Practice | Effect on Resilience |
|----------|---------------------|
| Single sourcing | No backup suppliers |
| Just-in-time ordering | No inventory buffer |
| Lowest cost focus | Efficiency over redundancy |
| Volume requirements | Small suppliers excluded |

## Just-in-Time Causes

### Efficiency Over Resilience

**Inventory Optimization**

| Practice | Benefit | Vulnerability |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Minimal inventory | Lower carrying costs | No buffer for disruption |
| Tight schedules | Reduced waste | No slack for delays |
| Single sourcing | Lower prices | No backup suppliers |
| Automated ordering | Labor efficiency | Inflexible to shocks |

**Performance Metrics**

| Metric | Optimizes For | Ignores |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| Inventory turns | Capital efficiency | Buffer capacity |
| Days sales of inventory | Working capital | Surge capability |
| On-time delivery | Schedule adherence | Alternative routes |
| Cost per unit | Efficiency | Redundancy |

### Financial Pressure

**Who Bears Risk**

| Actor | Pressure | Response |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Processors | Margin squeeze | Consolidate |
| Distributors | Customer demands | Cut inventory |
| Trucking | Rate competition | Reduce capacity |
| Farmers | Price volatility | No bargaining power |

**Short-Term Focus**

| Driver | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Quarterly earnings | Defer investment |
| Cost reduction targets | Cut buffers |

## Institutional Causes

### Regulatory Fragmentation

**Multiple Agencies**

| Short authorization cycles | Long-term planning difficult |

**Technical Assistance Gaps**

| Gap | Consequence |
|-----|-------------|
| Processing expertise | New entrants lack support |
| Food safety compliance | Regulatory burden falls on small |

```text
Competitive pressure → inventory reduction →
efficiency gains → industry standard →
no buffer capacity → disruption cascades →
crisis response → temporary buffers →
pressure returns → inventory cut again
```

### The Labor-Resilience Loop

```text
Low wages → worker turnover →
training costs → further wage pressure →
dangerous conditions → worker illness →

## Why Traditional Approaches Fall Short

### Capital Investment Alone

| Limitation | Why |
|------------|-----|
| One-time vs. ongoing | Infrastructure requires maintenance |
| Scale bias | Grants favor large projects |
| No market structure change | Concentration continues |
| No labor improvement | Workers still vulnerable |

### Deregulation Approach

| Limitation | Why |
|------------|-----|
| Historical evidence | Led to concentration |
| Market power persists | Small entrants disadvantaged |
| Externalities ignored | Fragility costs not priced |
| Race to bottom | Standards decline |

### Voluntary Coordination

| Limitation | Why |
|------------|-----|
| Competitive information | Not shared voluntarily |
| Free rider problem | Who invests in redundancy? |
| Short-term focus | Resilience undervalued |
| Crisis amnesia | Attention fades |

## Intervention Points

### High-Leverage Opportunities

1. **Antitrust enforcement**: Address processing concentration
2. **Regional infrastructure**: Invest in distributed capacity
3. **Worker protections**: Essential workers need essential rights
4. **Data visibility**: Require supply chain transparency
5. **Resilience metrics**: Incorporate into performance measures
6. **Maintenance funding**: Ongoing support, not just capital

### Structural vs. Incremental

| Approach | Examples | Potential |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Structural | Break up processors, mandate redundancy | High but politically difficult |
| Incremental | Processing grants, cold storage expansion | Achievable but insufficient alone |
| Market-based | Resilience insurance, risk pricing | Emerging, uncertain |
