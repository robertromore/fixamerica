# Supply Chain Resilience: Overview

Agricultural supply chain resilience—the capacity of the food system to withstand, adapt to, and recover from disruptions—has emerged as a critical national priority after the COVID-19 pandemic exposed severe vulnerabilities in meat processing, cold storage, transportation, and distribution networks. The U.S. food supply chain moves over 1 trillion pounds of food annually from 2 million farms through a complex network of processing facilities, storage, and transportation to 330 million consumers. When this system breaks down—whether from pandemics, natural disasters, labor strikes, or cyberattacks—the consequences ripple immediately through food prices, farmer incomes, and consumer access.
