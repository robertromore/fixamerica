## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Processing Grants with State Oversight

- **Bridges**: Conservative, Centrist, Liberal
- **Core agreement**: Expand regional processing with accountability.
- **Policy**: Federal grants administered by states with performance audits.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept state control; conservatives accept federal funding.
- **Viability**: High; broad agreement.

### Compromise 2: Cold Chain Upgrades with Workforce Commitments

- **Bridges**: Progressive, Populist, Centrist
- **Core agreement**: Modernize cold storage while creating local jobs.
- **Policy**: Grants tied to workforce training and regional coverage targets.
- **Concessions**: Industry accepts labor standards; reformers accept phased targets.
- **Viability**: Medium-high; depends on funding scale.

### Compromise 3: Data Dashboard with Privacy Safe Harbors

- **Bridges**: Conservative, Centrist, Liberal
- **Core agreement**: Improve visibility without exposing proprietary data.
- **Policy**: Aggregated reporting, opt-in tiers, and independent privacy audits.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept opt-in; conservatives accept limited reporting.
- **Viability**: Medium; hinges on governance design.

## Strategic Implications

- Most viable coalition centers on regional processing and cold chain modernization.
- Key obstacle is data transparency concerns and resistance to federal mandates.
- Bad-faith risk appears limited; focus on pilots with clear outcomes and privacy protections.
- Recommended approach: pass processing and cold chain acts first, then phase in data and resilience finance tools.
