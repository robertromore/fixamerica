# Supply Chain Resilience: Solutions

## Overview

Building agricultural supply chain resilience requires a comprehensive strategy that diversifies processing capacity, modernizes cold chain infrastructure, strengthens transportation networks, improves data visibility, and develops financial tools for recovery. Effective solutions must address the structural vulnerabilities exposed by COVID-19 and other disruptions while ensuring that investments deliver lasting benefits for farmers, consumers, and rural communities.
