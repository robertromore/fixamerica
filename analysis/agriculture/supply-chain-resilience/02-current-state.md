# Supply Chain Resilience: Current State

## Overview

The U.S. agricultural supply chain—the network of processing facilities, cold storage, transportation, and logistics that moves food from farms to consumers—faces significant resilience challenges. Processing capacity is highly concentrated in a small number of large facilities, particularly in meat and poultry. Cold storage is unevenly distributed, with aging infrastructure and rural gaps. Transportation networks struggle with driver shortages, underinvestment in short-line railroads, and periodic port congestion. Data systems remain fragmented, limiting visibility and coordination during disruptions. While federal investments are beginning to address these vulnerabilities, the system remains fragile.
