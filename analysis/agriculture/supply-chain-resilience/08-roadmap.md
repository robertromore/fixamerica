# Supply Chain Resilience: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines a phased approach to building agricultural supply chain resilience through coordinated investments in processing capacity, cold chain infrastructure, transportation networks, and data visibility. The strategy prioritizes regional redundancy, workforce development, and emergency response capabilities while building on existing programs and partnerships. Implementation spans a 5-year initial period with ongoing system maintenance and continuous improvement.
