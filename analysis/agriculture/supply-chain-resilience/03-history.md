# Supply Chain Resilience: History

## Overview

The history of American agricultural supply chains traces from fragmented local markets through federal infrastructure investments, deregulation-driven consolidation, and recent disruptions that exposed systemic vulnerabilities. Understanding this evolution reveals how policy choices created both remarkable efficiency and dangerous fragility.

## Lessons from History

### What Has Worked

1. **Federal infrastructure investment**: Rail, highway, port capacity built national markets
2. **Intermodal development**: Containerization improved efficiency
3. **Cold chain technology**: Year-round supply enabled
4. **Food safety regulation**: Consumer protection maintained
5. **Crisis response**: Wartime, pandemic mobilization possible

### What Has Not Worked

1. **Deregulation without oversight**: Concentration followed liberalization
2. **Efficiency without redundancy**: Just-in-time fragile
3. **Worker exclusions**: Food system workers left unprotected
4. **Ignoring regional infrastructure**: Small-scale capacity lost
5. **Data fragmentation**: Visibility gaps persist

### Unresolved Challenges

| Challenge | Current Status |
|-----------|----------------|
| Processing concentration | Grants begin diversification, market power unchanged |
| Worker protection | Still excluded from many labor laws |
| Cold chain gaps | Rural areas underserved |
| Climate adaptation | Infrastructure not prepared for extreme weather |
| Data coordination | Fragmented, proprietary systems |
