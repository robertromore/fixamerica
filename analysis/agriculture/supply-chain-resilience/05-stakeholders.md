# Supply Chain Resilience: Stakeholders

## Overview

Agricultural supply chain resilience involves a diverse ecosystem of stakeholders—from the farmers who produce food to the processors who transform it, from the truckers and railroads that move it to the retailers and consumers who receive it. Understanding who is affected by supply chain vulnerabilities, who has power to address them, and where interests align or conflict is essential for designing effective reforms that can build coalitions and sustain political support.
