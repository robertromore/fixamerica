# Supply Chain Resilience: Overview

## Executive Summary

Agricultural supply chain resilience—the capacity of the food system to withstand, adapt to, and recover from disruptions—has emerged as a critical national priority after the COVID-19 pandemic exposed severe vulnerabilities in meat processing, cold storage, transportation, and distribution networks. The U.S. food supply chain moves over 1 trillion pounds of food annually from 2 million farms through a complex network of processing facilities, storage, and transportation to 330 million consumers. When this system breaks down—whether from pandemics, natural disasters, labor strikes, or cyberattacks—the consequences ripple immediately through food prices, farmer incomes, and consumer access.

The core problem is excessive concentration and insufficient redundancy. Four companies control over 80% of beef processing; cold storage capacity is unevenly distributed with aging facilities; rural transportation networks face chronic underinvestment; and supply chain data systems remain fragmented, limiting the ability to reroute during disruptions. These vulnerabilities create a system that operates efficiently under normal conditions but fails catastrophically when stressed.

Building resilience requires diversifying processing capacity through regional facilities, modernizing cold chain infrastructure, strengthening rural transportation networks, improving supply chain data and transparency, and developing financial tools to help businesses recover from shocks. Strategic federal investment, coordinated with state and private sector partners, can create a food system that maintains affordability and access even during disruptions.
