# Supply Chain Resilience: Legislation

## Overview

Legislation should expand regional processing, modernize cold chain infrastructure, and build shared data systems that improve resilience while protecting proprietary information.

## Model Federal Bills

### 1. Regional Processing Capacity Act

**Purpose**: Fund regional meat, dairy, and specialty crop processing facilities with inspection and workforce support.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Regional Processing Capacity Act."

SEC. 2. GRANTS.
Provide grants and low-interest loans for regional processing capacity that meets food safety and resilience standards.
```

**Explanation**: Expands redundancy and market access for producers.

**Challenges**: Ensuring inspection staffing and technical assistance.

### 2. Cold Chain Modernization Act

**Purpose**: Upgrade cold storage, refrigerated transport, and intermodal hubs in rural corridors and specialty crop regions.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Cold Chain Modernization Act."

SEC. 2. PROGRAM.
Authorize grants for cold storage, refrigerated transport, and intermodal improvements tied to resilience benchmarks.
```

**Explanation**: Reduces spoilage and delays during disruptions.

**Challenges**: Capital intensity and fragmented ownership.

### 3. Supply Chain Data and Risk Transparency Act

**Purpose**: Establish a shared data platform for processing uptime, freight capacity, and cold storage availability.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Supply Chain Data and Risk Transparency Act."

SEC. 2. DATA PLATFORM.
Direct USDA and DOT to create a secure data platform with privacy protections and standardized metrics.
```

**Explanation**: Improves coordination and rerouting during disruptions.

**Challenges**: Data privacy and interoperability.

### 4. Resilience Finance and Insurance Act

**Purpose**: Expand loan guarantees and insurance tools for processors and logistics firms to recover from disruptions.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Resilience Finance and Insurance Act."

SEC. 2. SUPPORT.
Authorize loan guarantees and insurance pilots for food and agriculture supply chain resilience.
```

**Explanation**: Shortens recovery time and stabilizes operations.

**Challenges**: Underwriting models and program coordination.

## State Model Legislation

States can adopt "Food Supply Chain Resilience Acts" that:

- Create regional processing and cold storage incentive pools.
- Require resilience plans for state-funded food infrastructure.
- Align state freight planning with USDA and DOT data dashboards.

## Regulatory Framework

- USDA AMS and FSIS should coordinate inspection capacity with processing expansion grants.
- USDOT should align freight planning grants with USDA cold chain priorities.
- DHS and USDA should establish data governance standards for resilience reporting.

## Legal Considerations

- Data privacy: Protect commercial confidentiality in shared dashboards.
- Preemption: Federal baseline should allow states to exceed resilience standards.
- Enforcement: Require audits of grant performance and clawbacks for noncompliance.
- Sunset and review: GAO review every five years on capacity gains and resilience outcomes.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Capacity overstatement | Facilities claim capacity that is not operational | Medium |
| Data gaming | Firms underreport disruptions | Medium |
| Regional imbalance | Grants cluster in already strong regions | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Inspection bottlenecks | Delays in new plant approvals | Staffing limits |
| Fragmented logistics | Lack of interoperable data systems | Proprietary platforms |
| Recovery gaps | Slow restart after disasters | Limited insurance tools |

### Rectification Procedures

1. Require operational verification and utilization reporting for funded facilities.
2. Establish secure data standards and independent audits for dashboard reporting.
3. Allocate set-asides for underserved regions and smaller processors.

### General Implementation Concerns

Coordinate USDA, DOT, and DHS to avoid duplicative reporting and ensure consistent resilience metrics.
