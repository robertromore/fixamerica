# Supply Chain Resilience: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative framework for supply chain resilience aims to transform a food system optimized for maximum efficiency and concentration into one designed for stability, redundancy, and regional autonomy. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent geopolitical shocks exposed the fragility of a system where four companies control 85% of beef processing and where regional food infrastructure has been hollowed out.

This legislation pursues a three-pronged strategy: (1) decentralizing processing capacity through targeted investments in small and mid-sized facilities; (2) strengthening local and regional distribution networks to shorten supply chains; and (3) hardening critical food infrastructure against cyber and physical threats. The approach combines infrastructure finance with regulatory reforms to level the playing field for independent operators.

---

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for supply chain resilience reform. Congress has broad authority under the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) to regulate interstate food commerce and under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) to fund infrastructure and development programs.*

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To enhance the resilience of the United States food supply chain by decentralizing processing capacity and supporting independent facilities.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Food Supply Chain Resilience and Decentralization Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The concentration of meat and poultry processing in a small number of large facilities creates single points of failure in the food supply chain.
(2) During the COVID-19 pandemic, the closure of a few large plants led to simultaneous meat shortages for consumers and euthanasia of livestock by farmers.
(3) Small and mid-sized processors lack access to the capital required to expand capacity and meet federal inspection standards.
(4) A diversified processing sector is essential for national security and rural economic development.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) INDEPENDENT PROCESSOR.—The term "independent processor" means a meat or poultry processing facility that is not owned or controlled by a packer with more than 5 percent national market share.
(2) PROCESSING CAPACITY.—The term "processing capacity" means the maximum number of head of livestock or pounds of poultry that a facility can slaughter and process per day under Federal inspection.
(3) COOPERATIVE INTERSTATE SHIPMENT.—The term "cooperative interstate shipment" means the program established under section 501 of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 683) allowing state-inspected establishments to ship products interstate.
(4) SECRETARY.—The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Agriculture.

SEC. 4. MEAT AND POULTRY PROCESSING EXPANSION PROGRAM.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary shall establish a competitive grant program to assist independent processors in constructing, expanding, or modernizing facilities.
(b) ELIGIBLE COSTS.—Grants may be used for—
    (1) construction of new facilities;

|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Issue Grant NOFA | 90 days after enactment | USDA Rural Development |
| Establish Loan Guarantee Rules | 180 days after enactment | USDA FSA |
| First Grant Awards | FY 2027 | USDA |

**Challenges**:

- **Regulatory Complexity**: Small plants struggle with FSIS regulations designed for large facilities.
- **Labor Supply**: Even with training, rural areas may lack sufficient workforce.

**Refinements**:

- Create a "regulatory navigator" service within USDA specifically for grant recipients.

### The Local Food Infrastructure and Market Access Act

**Purpose**: To rebuild regional food systems by funding aggregation hubs, cold storage, and distribution networks that connect local farmers to institutions and retailers.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Food Hub Infrastructure Grants**: Funds the construction of aggregation and distribution centers (food hubs) that allow small farmers to access wholesale markets.
2. **Farm-to-Institution Incentives**: Provides matching funds to schools, hospitals, and food banks to purchase locally grown food.

5. **Local Food Data**: Mandates USDA to collect and report data on local and regional food system economic impact.

**Draft Text**:

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To strengthen local and regional food systems, improve market access for small and mid-sized producers, and enhance community food security.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Local Food Infrastructure and Market Access Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Local and regional food systems provide economic opportunities for farmers and increase community resilience.
(2) Lack of aggregation and distribution infrastructure prevents small farmers from accessing institutional markets.
(3) Farm-to-school programs improve child nutrition while supporting local economies.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) FOOD HUB.—The term "food hub" means a business or organization that actively manages the aggregation, distribution, and marketing of source-identified food products.
(2) LOCAL FOOD.—The term "local food" means food produced within the State or less than 400 miles from the product's final destination.

SEC. 4. REGIONAL FOOD SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS.

(a) PROGRAM.—The Secretary shall establish a program to provide grants and low-interest loans for the development of food hubs, cold storage facilities, and local food distribution networks.
(b) ELIGIBILITY.—Eligible entities include cooperatives, non-profit organizations, local governments, and businesses primarily serving local markets.

SEC. 5. INSTITUTIONAL PROCUREMENT INCENTIVES.

(a) PILOT PROGRAM.—The Secretary shall establish a pilot program to provide additional reimbursement to schools and emergency feeding organizations for the purchase of local food.
(b) MATCHING FUNDS.—The Secretary may provide up to $0.10 per meal in matching funds for local food purchases.

SEC. 6. VALUE-ADDED PRODUCER GRANTS.

Section 231(b)(7) of the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 (7 U.S.C. 1632a(b)(7)) is amended by striking "$40,000,000" and inserting "$100,000,000".

SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

The Secretary shall submit a biennial report to Congress on the economic impact of local food systems, including job creation and farm income retention.

SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $350,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $450,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Solves the logistics problem for small farms; they can grow the food but can't efficiently get it to a hospital or school without a hub.
- **Section 5**: Creates reliable demand. Infrastructure is useless without buyers; this incentivizes large institutions to be those buyers.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Infrastructure Grant Rules | 120 days after enactment | USDA AMS |
| Procurement Pilot Launch | FY 2027 | USDA FNS |

**Challenges**:

- **Seasonality**: Institutional buyers need year-round supply; local systems are seasonal.
- **Price**: Local food is often more expensive than global commodities.

**Refinements**:

- Allow for "regional" definitions that cross state lines to accommodate natural foodsheds.

### The Critical Food Infrastructure Security Act

**Purpose**: To designate food systems as critical national security infrastructure, mandating cybersecurity standards and establishing strategic reserves for essential inputs.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Critical Infrastructure Designation**: Formally codifies food and agriculture as a critical infrastructure sector with DHS oversight.
2. **Cybersecurity Standards**: Mandates minimum cybersecurity standards for major food processors and distributors to prevent ransomware attacks (like the JBS hack).
3. **Strategic Input Reserve**: Authorizes a pilot program for a strategic reserve of critical agricultural inputs (fertilizer, veterinary medicines).
4. **Supply Chain Mapping**: Requires USDA and DHS to map critical supply chain nodes and identify vulnerabilities.

**Draft Text**:

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To protect the food and agriculture sector from cyber and physical threats and ensure supply chain continuity.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Critical Food Infrastructure Security Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The food and agriculture sector is increasingly digitized and vulnerable to cyberattacks.
(2) Recent ransomware attacks on major meatpackers and grain cooperatives have disrupted national food supplies.
(3) Dependence on imported fertilizers and inputs creates strategic vulnerabilities.

SEC. 3. CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS.

(a) STANDARDS.—The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, shall establish minimum cybersecurity standards for covered food and agriculture entities.
(b) COVERED ENTITIES.—Entities with annual revenue exceeding $500,000,000 or controlling more than 5 percent of a national commodity market.

SEC. 4. STRATEGIC INPUT RESERVE PILOT.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of Agriculture shall establish a pilot program to maintain a strategic reserve of critical agricultural inputs, including fertilizer components and animal vaccines.
(b) RELEASE.—The Secretary may release reserves in the event of a declared supply chain emergency.

SEC. 5. SUPPLY CHAIN MAPPING.

The Secretary of Agriculture shall conduct a comprehensive mapping of the food supply chain to identify single points of failure and geographic concentrations of risk.

SEC. 6. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

The Secretary of Homeland Security shall report annually to Congress on cyber threats to the food and agriculture sector.

SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3**: Treats food companies like power plants or banks—too critical to be left unsecured.
- **Section 4**: Creates a buffer against global shocks (like the Ukraine war's impact on fertilizer) to keep U.S. farms running.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Cyber Standards Proposed | 180 days after enactment | DHS CISA |
| Supply Chain Map | 1 year after enactment | USDA/DHS |

**Challenges**:

- **Industry Pushback**: Companies resist mandates on internal IT systems.
- **Cost**: Maintaining physical reserves of fertilizer is expensive and hazardous.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Regional Food System Resilience Act

**Purpose**: To enable states to invest in local processing and distribution, creating a "state meat inspection" program that complements federal rules.

**Adaptability Notes**: States with large livestock sectors should focus on the meat inspection components; others on the procurement incentives.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Regional Food System Resilience Act".

SECTION 2. STATE MEAT INSPECTION.
(a) PROGRAM.—The Department of Agriculture shall establish a State Meat and Poultry Inspection (MPI) program that meets or exceeds federal standards.
(b) COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT.—The Department shall seek a Cooperative Interstate Shipment (CIS) agreement with USDA to allow state-inspected products to be sold across state lines.

SECTION 3. LOCAL FOOD PROCUREMENT PREFERENCE.
(a) PREFERENCE.—State agencies shall give a 10 percent price preference to food products grown and processed within the State.
(b) TARGET.—It is the goal of the State to source 20 percent of all institutional food locally by 2030.

SECTION 4. RESILIENCE GRANT FUND.
(a) FUND.—There is established a Food System Resilience Fund.
(b) USE.—Grants for cold storage, processing equipment, and distribution logistics for local food businesses.

SECTION 5. APPROPRIATION.
There is appropriated from the General Fund $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 to carry out this Act.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 2**: Allows small plants to operate under state rules (often more responsive/accessible) while still accessing broader markets via CIS.
- **Section 3**: Uses state purchasing power to anchor the local food economy.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and Rural Development (RD).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Grant Criteria**: Define "independent processor" and "food hub" eligibility to prevent capture by large incumbents. Deadline: 90 days.
2. **Cybersecurity Rules**: DHS CISA must define specific IT standards for food facilities.
3. **CIS Expansion**: FSIS must streamline the application process for states joining the Cooperative Interstate Shipment program.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Grant Clawbacks**: Authority to recover funds if facilities are sold to large packers within 10 years.
- **Cyber Audits**: DHS authority to audit critical food infrastructure for compliance.
- **Civil Penalties**: Fines for non-compliance with security standards.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause**: Federal regulation of food supply chains is well-established.
**Preemption**: State meat inspection laws must be "at least equal to" federal standards (FMIA/PPIA). The model act works within this framework.

### Preemption

The Federal Meat Inspection Act preempts state inspection requirements that are *different* from federal ones, but allows states to run their own "equal to" programs.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance relies on grant reporting and inspection verification. Cybersecurity enforcement will require new capacity at DHS/USDA.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **Acquisition by Majors** | Big packers buy the new subsidized small plants. | High | "Anti-flip" clause: Grant recipients must repay funds if sold to a large packer within 10 years. |
| **"Local" Washing** | Distributors relabel national produce as "local." | Medium | Strict definitions and audit trails for "local" procurement incentives. |
| **Cyber Exemptions** | Companies claim they are "too small" to secure. | High | Tiered standards based on revenue/market share, not just employee count. |
| **Pass-through Grants** | Universities take high overhead from training grants. | Low | Cap indirect costs at 10% for workforce grants. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Labor Shortage** | New plants can't find workers. | Demographics/Wages. | Workforce training grants (Section 5). |
| **Market Access** | Small plants can't get shelf space. | Retail concentration. | Antitrust enforcement (see Competition subtopic). |
| **Cost of Goods** | Local food is more expensive. | Lack of scale. | Procurement incentives to bridge price gap. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-Flip Clause**: Amend Section 4 of the Resilience Act to include a 10-year clawback provision.
2. **Retail Access**: Coordinate with FTC to investigate slotting fees that block small processors.
3. **Definition Tightening**: Statutorily define "independent" to exclude subsidiaries of major packers.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **Grant Programs**: Authorization expires after 5 years; requires review of capacity added.
- **Reserves Pilot**: Sunsets after 5 years pending evaluation of effectiveness.
