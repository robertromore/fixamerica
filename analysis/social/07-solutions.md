# Social: Solutions

## Overview

Fixing America's inadequate safety net requires reforms across multiple dimensions: expanding cash assistance, improving program design, reducing administrative barriers, and creating automatic stabilizers that respond to need. Solutions range from incremental improvements within current programs to transformative restructuring. The 2021 expanded Child Tax Credit demonstrated that policy choices can dramatically reduce poverty; the challenge is building political support for durable reforms.

### Political Feasibility vs. Ambition
