# Social: Current State

## Overview

America's social safety net provides inadequate protection against poverty, leaving millions without sufficient support despite a patchwork of federal and state programs. The official poverty rate stands at 11.5% (38 million people), but this measure understates hardship—nearly 40% of Americans cannot cover a $400 emergency expense. Cash assistance programs have collapsed, with TANF reaching only 21% of poor families compared to 68% in 1996. Food assistance remains the most robust program, but benefits are often insufficient. Unemployment insurance reaches barely a quarter of jobless workers. The result is a safety net full of holes, where program design, benefit cliffs, and administrative barriers leave vulnerable populations without adequate support.
