# Social: Roadmap

## Overview

Transforming America's social safety net requires a phased approach that builds on achievable wins, expands political coalitions, and progressively addresses structural barriers. This roadmap sequences reforms from immediate administrative actions to fundamental restructuring, recognizing that safety net reform requires simultaneous action at federal and state levels. The 2021 CTC expansion demonstrated that dramatic progress is possible; the challenge is building durable political support.
