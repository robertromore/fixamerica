# Unemployment Insurance: Current State

## The Problem Today

### A System Failing to Reach the Unemployed

The unemployment insurance system has become increasingly disconnected from the labor market it is meant to protect. Only 28% of unemployed workers receive UI benefits--the lowest recipiency rate in the program's history. This fundamental coverage failure means that the majority of Americans who lose their jobs cannot count on this core safety net.

**The Coverage Crisis**:

- 72% of unemployed workers receive no UI benefits
- Gig workers, independent contractors largely excluded
- Part-time workers often ineligible
- New labor force entrants lack work history
- Administrative barriers deter eligible workers

**Frozen Federal Parameters**:

- FUTA taxable wage base: $7,000 since 1983
- Federal minimum benefit standards: none beyond conformity
- Administrative funding: declining in real terms
- Extended Benefits triggers: outdated metrics

### Benefit Inadequacy

UI benefits fail to replace enough income for workers to maintain stability:

| Measure | National Average |
|---------|------------------|
| Average weekly benefit | $385 |
| Wage replacement rate | ~40% |
| Maximum weekly benefit (median state) | $513 |
| Minimum weekly benefit (median state) | $89 |

**Benefit Erosion**:

- Benefits have not kept pace with wage growth
- Maximum benefits often cap out at low levels
- Part-time workers receive proportionally less
- Waiting weeks reduce total support

### State-by-State Variation

The federal-state structure creates vast inequality:

**Highest Benefit States**:

| State | Maximum Weekly Benefit |
|-------|----------------------|
| Massachusetts | $1,015 |
| Washington | $999 |
| New Jersey | $830 |
| Minnesota | $820 |
| Connecticut | $785 |

**Lowest Benefit States**:

| State | Maximum Weekly Benefit |
|-------|----------------------|
| Mississippi | $235 |
| Louisiana | $275 |
| Arizona | $320 |
| Florida | $325 |
| Tennessee | $340 |

### Duration Limits

**Standard Duration**:

- 26 weeks: Traditional standard (still in 43 states + DC)
- 12-20 weeks: 7 states have reduced below 26 weeks

**States Below 26 Weeks**:

| State | Maximum Duration |
|-------|-----------------|
| North Carolina | 12-20 weeks (variable) |
| Florida | 12-23 weeks (variable) |
| Georgia | 14-20 weeks (variable) |
| South Carolina | 20 weeks |
| Michigan | 20 weeks |
| Missouri | 20 weeks |
| Arkansas | 16-20 weeks (variable) |

### Eligibility Barriers

**Monetary Requirements**:

States require minimum earnings during the base period:

| Requirement Type | Typical Range |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Minimum base period earnings | $1,500-$6,000 |
| High quarter earnings | $1,000-$3,000 |
| Weeks of work required | 15-20 weeks |

**Non-Monetary Requirements**:

- Must have lost job "through no fault of own"
- Must be "able and available" for work
- Must conduct "active" job search
- Cannot refuse "suitable" work

## Key Statistics

### National UI Program (2023)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total UI recipients (average week) | 1.7 million |
| Initial claims (weekly average) | 220,000 |
| Continued claims (weekly average) | 1.8 million |
| Average benefit duration | 14.8 weeks |
| Exhaustion rate | 32% |

### Trust Fund Status

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total state trust fund balances | $81 billion |
| States below DOL solvency standard | 21 |
| Average SUTA tax rate | 1.2% |
| SUTA taxable wage base (state median) | $12,000 |

### Employer Taxes

| Level | Tax Details |
|-------|-------------|
| Federal (FUTA) | 0.6% on first $7,000 |
| State (SUTA) | 0.5%-5.4%+ on varying wage bases |
| Experience rating range | 0.0%-12%+ |

### Recipiency by Demographics

| Group | Relative Receipt Rate |
|-------|----------------------|
| White workers | Baseline |
| Black workers | 40% lower |
| Hispanic workers | 30% lower |
| Part-time workers | 50% lower |
| Low-wage workers | 35% lower |

## Impact

### On Unemployed Workers

**Financial Hardship**:

- 72% receive no UI benefits when unemployed
- Those receiving benefits face 60% income loss
- Benefits often below poverty line for families
- Waiting weeks delay critical support

**Employment Outcomes**:

- Inadequate benefits pressure workers into unsuitable jobs
- Short duration forces premature return to work
- Poor job matching reduces long-term earnings
- Lack of training support limits advancement

### On the Economy

**Reduced Stabilization**:

- Low recipiency weakens automatic stabilizer function
- Consumer spending drops more during recessions
- Local economies suffer from reduced circulation
- Recovery takes longer

**Inefficiency**:

- Poor job matching from benefit inadequacy
- Reduced labor mobility
- Skills atrophy from extended unemployment without support
- Human capital loss

### On Employers

**Experience Rating Effects**:

- Incentivizes claim contestation
- May discourage temporary layoffs (can be positive or negative)
- Creates administrative burden
- Cross-subsidization between stable and unstable employers

### On Racial Equity

**Disparate Access**:

- Black workers 40% less likely to receive UI
- States with larger Black populations have stricter rules
- Historical exclusions embedded in state laws
- Administrative discretion produces disparate outcomes

## Recent Developments

### COVID-19 Pandemic Programs

The pandemic revealed UI system failures and required unprecedented federal intervention:

**Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA)**:

- Extended coverage to gig workers, independent contractors
- Covered self-employed, new labor force entrants
- 14.8 million recipients at peak
- Demonstrated feasibility of broader coverage

**Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC)**:

- $600/week supplement (later $300)
- Raised replacement rates above 100% for many
- Demonstrated impact of adequate benefits
- Poverty reduced significantly

**Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC)**:

- Extended duration beyond state limits
- Up to 79 total weeks of benefits
- Maintained support through prolonged unemployment

**Lessons Learned**:

- Current system wholly inadequate for major shock
- Gig worker coverage is administratively feasible
- Higher benefits improve outcomes without harming job search
- State IT systems require major investment

### State Actions Since Pandemic

**Restrictive Changes**:

- Some states reduced duration further
- Work search requirements tightened
- Faster exhaustion of pandemic benefits
- Drug testing requirements added in some states

**Expansive Changes**:

- Several states increased benefit levels
- Some expanded eligibility for part-time work
- Alternative base periods adopted in more states
- IT system upgrades initiated

### Federal Proposals

**Biden Administration**:

- Proposed UI modernization with minimum standards
- Called for coverage of gig workers
- Proposed federal floor on replacement rates
- Sought increased administrative funding

**Congressional Action**:

- Jobseeker Allowance Act proposed
- UI modernization legislation introduced
- Automatic Extended Benefits triggers proposed
- No major legislation enacted

## Trust Fund Solvency

### Current Status

**Healthy Funds**: 29 states meet DOL solvency standard

**At Risk**: 21 states below minimum solvency

**Outstanding Loans**: 2 states still carry pandemic debt

### Financing Challenges

**Frozen FUTA Base**:

- $7,000 taxable wage base since 1983
- Would be $50,000+ if indexed to wages
- Federal revenue declining in real terms
- Limits federal administrative capacity

**State Variation**:

| State Wage Base | Number of States |
|-----------------|------------------|
| $7,000-$10,000 | 22 |
| $10,001-$20,000 | 18 |
| $20,001-$40,000 | 8 |
| Above $40,000 | 3 |

### Experience Rating Issues

**Problems**:

- Encourages claim contestation
- Creates perverse incentives during recessions
- Cross-subsidization concerns
- Administrative complexity

**Potential Benefits**:

- Internalizes layoff costs
- Rewards stable employment
- Reduces opportunistic layoffs
