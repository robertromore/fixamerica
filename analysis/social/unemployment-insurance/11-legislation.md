# Unemployment Insurance: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Modernizing unemployment insurance requires comprehensive legislative action at both federal and state levels. The federal-state structure means reform must address minimum federal standards while preserving appropriate state flexibility. This document provides model legislation for the four key reform areas: comprehensive UI modernization, gig worker coverage, trust fund solvency, and pandemic preparedness.

## Constitutional Amendments

### Economic Security for Workers Amendment

**Purpose**: Establish a constitutional right to income security during involuntary unemployment.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. All persons who become unemployed through no fault of
their own shall have the right to temporary income assistance
sufficient to meet basic needs while seeking reemployment.

SECTION 2. Congress and the States shall ensure that systems of
unemployment compensation:
(a) cover all workers regardless of classification or employment
    arrangement;
(b) provide benefits adequate to replace a reasonable portion of
    prior earnings;
(c) continue for a duration sufficient to enable appropriate
    reemployment; and
(d) operate without discrimination based on race, national origin,
    gender, or other protected characteristic.

SECTION 3. Congress shall have the power to establish minimum
national standards for unemployment compensation and to enforce
this article by appropriate legislation.

SECTION 4. The rights established by this article shall not be
construed to diminish other rights retained by the people.

SECTION 5. This article shall take effect two years after the
date of ratification.

```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 1**: Establishes affirmative right to unemployment assistance
- **Section 2**: Enumerates coverage, adequacy, duration, and equity requirements
- **Section 3**: Empowers federal minimum standards
- **Section 4**: Non-diminishment clause
- **Section 5**: Implementation period

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Positive rights unfamiliar | Other countries include economic rights |
| Enforcement concerns | Courts can develop standards |
| Cost implications | Right does not mandate specific benefit level |
| Federalism objections | Federal standards with state administration |

## Federal Legislation

### UI Modernization Act

**Purpose**: Establish comprehensive federal minimum standards for state unemployment insurance programs while preserving state flexibility to exceed those standards.

    wages, below the 50 percent target considered adequate.
(4) Gig workers, independent contractors, part-time workers,
    and new labor force entrants are systematically excluded.
(5) Black workers are 40 percent less likely to receive UI
    benefits than white workers, reflecting historical
    exclusions and ongoing disparities.

**Purpose**: Extend unemployment insurance coverage to gig workers and independent contractors through comprehensive worker classification reform.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Worker Security Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Approximately 16 million American workers are classified
    as independent contractors, many of whom are economically
    dependent on a single client or platform.
(2) Misclassification of employees as independent contractors
    deprives workers of unemployment insurance protection.
(3) The COVID-19 pandemic revealed that millions of gig
    workers lacked access to the basic safety net.
(4) Pandemic Unemployment Assistance demonstrated that
    coverage of non-traditional workers is administratively
    feasible.
(5) Worker classification inconsistency across federal and
    state laws creates confusion and exploitation.

SEC. 3. FEDERAL DEFINITION OF EMPLOYEE.

(a) IN GENERAL.--For purposes of all federal labor and
    employment laws, including unemployment compensation
    coverage requirements:
    (1) A worker performing services for compensation shall

    (2) The worker's opportunity for profit or loss depending
        on managerial skill;
    (3) The relative investments of the employer and worker;

    workers shall contribute to a portable benefits fund at
    a rate not less than 5 percent of payments to such workers.

(c) BENEFIT COVERAGE.--Portable benefits shall include:
    (1) Unemployment-type assistance;
    (2) Paid sick leave;
    (3) Retirement contributions; and
    (4) Other benefits as determined by the Secretary.

Solvency Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) State UI trust funds are chronically underfunded, with
    21 states below the Department of Labor solvency standard.
(2) During recessions, underfunded trust funds force states
    to borrow, then cut benefits or raise taxes to repay.
(3) The FUTA taxable wage base has been frozen at $7,000
    since 1983, eroding federal revenue.
(4) Forward funding during good economic times is essential
    for adequate benefits during downturns.
(5) Automatic stabilizers would reduce the need for ad hoc
    congressional action during crises.

SEC. 3. TRUST FUND SOLVENCY REQUIREMENTS.

(a) MINIMUM SOLVENCY STANDARD.--Each State shall maintain UI
    trust fund reserves sufficient to pay at least one year
    of benefits at the highest payment levels experienced

    (3) 25 percent of solvency standard: 0.3 percentage point.

(d) COUNTER-CYCLICAL RELIEF.--Automatic tax increases under
    subsection (c) shall be suspended during periods when
    the state unemployment rate exceeds 6.5 percent.

SEC. 4. FEDERAL REINSURANCE.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--There is established a Federal
    Unemployment Insurance Reinsurance Fund.

    (1) Appropriations as authorized;
    (2) Additional FUTA revenue from wage base increase; and
    (3) Repayments of federal loans to states.

(c) COVERAGE.--The Fund shall provide reinsurance to state
    trust funds when:
    (1) The national unemployment rate exceeds 7.5 percent;
    (2) A state's insured unemployment rate exceeds 5 percent;
        and
    (3) The state trust fund balance is below 50 percent of
        the solvency standard.

(d) TERMS.--Reinsurance payments shall be:
    (1) Interest-free during the covered period;
    (2) Repayable over 10 years beginning when unemployment
        returns to normal levels; and
    (3) Forgivable for extraordinary events as determined
        by the Secretary.

    to include:
    (1) Base rate of 0.6 percent (after credits);
    (2) Solvency surcharge of 0.1 percent when national
        trust fund balances fall below adequate levels;
    (3) Stabilization surcharge during periods of low
        unemployment to build reserves.

SEC. 6. EXPERIENCE RATING REFORM.

(a) MINIMUM TAX RATES.--States shall not permit employer tax
    rates below 0.5 percent except for new employers with
    no layoff history.

(b) MAXIMUM TAX RATES.--States shall set maximum tax rates
    sufficient to ensure experience rating remains meaningful.

(c) SOCIALIZED COSTS.--Costs that cannot be charged to
    individual employers (extended benefits, systemic
    unemployment) shall be funded through a socialized
    tax rate applied to all employers.

(d) CLAIM CONTESTATION.--States shall:
    (1) Limit employer contestation to factual disputes;
    (2) Provide worker representation at hearings;
    (3) Impose costs on employers for frivolous contests; and
    (4) Report contestation rates and outcomes publicly.

SEC. 7. REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

(a) ANNUAL REPORT.--The Secretary shall publish annual reports
    on trust fund solvency across states.

(b) EARLY WARNING.--The Secretary shall provide notice to
    Congress when national or state trust fund levels fall
    below adequacy thresholds.

    insurance system, with claims exceeding 23 million
    per week at peak.
(2) Ad hoc congressional action was required to extend

(3) Delays in enacting and implementing emergency programs
    caused substantial hardship.
(4) State IT systems, some over 40 years old, could not

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Federal benefit standards | Valid exercise of spending power |
| Conditional FUTA credits | Established precedent from 1935 |
| Worker classification standards | Commerce clause authority |
| State mandate concerns | Conditional spending, not mandate |

**Federalism**

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| State administration | Preserved under reform |
| State flexibility | States can exceed minimums |
| Coercion concerns | Conditions reasonable given federal interest |
| Preemption | Federal floor with state supplementation |

**Due Process**

| Issue | Analysis |

| Eligibility changes | Prospective application avoids issues |
| Benefit calculations | Rational basis review |
| Classification determinations | Adequate procedures required |

### Preemption Questions

| Area | Analysis |
|------|----------|
| State UI laws | Federal minimums with state administration |
| Worker classification | Federal standard for federal programs |
| ERISA | Limited preemption for UI |
| State labor laws | Federal floor, states can exceed |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| FUTA credit reduction | Traditional enforcement tool |
| Administrative funding | Withholding for non-compliance |
| Direct payment | Federal backup for non-compliant states |
| Private litigation | Workers can sue for misclassification |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### UI Modernization Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Benefit calculation manipulation | States could use formulas that technically meet replacement rate but result in lower benefits | Medium |
| Alternative base period restrictions | States could impose conditions making ABP hard to access | Medium |
| Good cause interpretation | States could narrowly interpret "compelling" circumstances | Medium |
| Part-time work definitions | States could define part-time narrowly | Low |
| Transition period delays | States could delay compliance using phase-in | Medium |
| Data collection incompleteness | States could collect data but not report accurately | Low |

| Complexity for small business | Legitimate contractors confused | Necessarily broad standard |
| Transition costs | Employers face immediate tax increases | Reclassification effect |
| Worker preference claims | Some workers may prefer contractor status | Tax and flexibility considerations |

#### Rectification Procedures

3. **Portable benefits balance**: Cap portable benefits rate so proper classification is economically preferable; audit contribution compliance
4. **Enforcement capacity**: Dedicated funding for classification investigations; whistleblower incentives
5. **Self-certification verification**: Random audits of exempt workers; penalties for false certification
6. **Penalty effectiveness**: Increase penalties to exceed compliance costs; criminal liability for repeat offenders

2. **General fund prohibition**: Require tax-based funding only; audit fund sources
3. **Reinsurance conditions**: Require minimum state reserve before federal backup; graduated support based on state effort
4. **Experience rating limits**: Minimum tax floor; cap on rate variation; socialized cost sharing for extended benefits
5. **Contestation reform**: Limit grounds for contest; impose costs on frivolous contests; worker representation requirement
6. **Solvency timeline**: Annual milestones with enforcement; sanctions for insufficient progress

6. **IT acceleration**: Shared services option; federal technical assistance; off-the-shelf solutions
7. **Appropriation protection**: Entitlement status; political durability through broad constituency
8. **Phase-out adjustment**: Gradual reduction; regional variation allowed; employment quality metrics

### Cross-Cutting Issues
