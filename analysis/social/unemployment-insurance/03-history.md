# Unemployment Insurance: History

## Origins

### Pre-New Deal Landscape

Before the Social Security Act of 1935, unemployed American workers had virtually no public support:

**Private and Union Efforts**:

- Trade union "out of work" benefits (limited reach)
- Company welfare programs (rare, discretionary)
- Mutual aid societies
- Private charity and poor relief

**State Experiments**:

- Wisconsin enacted first state UI law (1932)
- Ohio, New York debated proposals
- Little action elsewhere

**The Great Depression Crisis**:

- Unemployment reached 25%
- Private charity overwhelmed
- Mass destitution and homelessness
- Political pressure for action intensified

### The Social Security Act of 1935

**Design Choices**:

| Choice | Rationale | Consequence |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Federal-state system | Constitutional concerns, federalism | State variation, inequality |
| FUTA tax offset | Incentivize state action | All states adopted programs |
| Employer-only tax | Political feasibility | Worker stake reduced |
| Experience rating | Internalize layoff costs | Claim contestation |
| State administration | Existing capacity | Uneven implementation |

**Initial Coverage**:

- Limited to private sector employees
- Excluded agriculture, domestic work
- Excluded small employers
- Covered approximately 60% of workforce

**Racial Dimensions**:

Southern Democrats insisted on exclusions for agriculture and domestic work--sectors where Black workers were concentrated. These exclusions, while framed as administrative, deliberately limited benefits for Black Americans.

## Evolution

### Post-War Expansion (1945-1970)

**Coverage Expansion**:

- Federal employees added (1954)
- Ex-servicemembers covered (1958)
- Small employers included (1970)
- Nonprofit employees covered (1970)

**Federal Standards**:

- Extended Benefits program created (1970)
- Automatic triggers for high unemployment
- Federal-state cost sharing for extensions

**Benefit Improvements**:

- States raised benefit levels
- Duration extended in many states
- Recipiency rates peaked around 50%

### Retrenchment Era (1980-Present)

**1980s Cutbacks**:

- FUTA wage base frozen at $7,000 (1983)
- Extended Benefits triggers tightened
- State trust fund borrowing increased
- Recipiency began declining

**1990s Changes**:

- Work search requirements tightened
- Interstate wage combining improved
- Alternative base periods adopted in some states
- Profiling for reemployment services began

**2000s Erosion**:

- Several states reduced duration below 26 weeks
- Benefit replacement rates declined
- Administrative funding cuts
- IT systems deteriorated

### Great Recession Response (2008-2013)

**Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC)**:

- Federal extended benefits beyond EB program
- Duration reached 99 weeks in some states
- Demonstrated need for automatic stabilizers
- Programs expired before full recovery

**Trust Fund Crisis**:

- 35 states borrowed from federal fund
- Some borrowed over $10 billion
- Repayment required tax increases, benefit cuts
- Highlighted structural underfunding

### COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-2021)

**Unprecedented Intervention**:

The CARES Act (March 2020) created:

- **Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA)**: Coverage for gig workers, self-employed
- **Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC)**: $600/week supplement
- **Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC)**: Extended duration

**Scale**:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Peak weekly recipients | 23 million |
| Total federal spending | ~$800 billion |
| PUA recipients at peak | 14.8 million |
| Maximum duration | 79 weeks |

**System Failures Exposed**:

- Antiquated IT systems crashed
- Fraud exploited weak verification
- State administrative capacity inadequate
- Weeks of delay for claimants
- Massive backlogs

**Lessons Demonstrated**:

- Gig worker coverage is feasible
- Higher benefits did not discourage job search
- Automatic stabilizers would have been more efficient
- Major IT investment needed

## Key Legislative Milestones

### Federal Legislation

| Year | Legislation | Key Provisions |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1935 | Social Security Act | Created federal-state UI system |
| 1954 | UI Amendments | Federal employee coverage |
| 1958 | Temporary UC Act | First federal extension program |
| 1970 | Employment Security Amendments | Extended Benefits program |
| 1976 | Tax Reduction Act | Emergency extensions |
| 1982 | Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act | EB restrictions |
| 1983 | Surface Transportation Act | FUTA wage base frozen |
| 2008 | Emergency UC Act | Great Recession extensions |
| 2020 | CARES Act | Pandemic programs (PUA, FPUC, PEUC) |
| 2020 | Continued Assistance Act | Extended pandemic programs |
| 2021 | American Rescue Plan | Extended FPUC at $300 |

### State Developments

**Duration Reductions**:

| State | Year | Change |
|-------|------|--------|
| Michigan | 2011 | 26 to 20 weeks |
| Florida | 2011 | 26 to 12-23 weeks (variable) |
| Georgia | 2012 | 26 to 14-20 weeks |
| North Carolina | 2013 | 26 to 12-20 weeks |
| South Carolina | 2010 | 26 to 20 weeks |

**Alternative Base Periods**:

Many states adopted alternative base periods to cover more recent work, but significant variation remains.

## Historical Patterns

### Recipiency Rate Decline

| Period | Approximate Rate | Key Factors |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| 1950s | 50% | Initial program maturity |
| 1960s | 45% | Coverage expansion |
| 1970s | 43% | Economic disruption |
| 1980s | 38% | Tightening eligibility |
| 1990s | 35% | Work structure changes |
| 2000s | 32% | Further restrictions |
| 2010s | 28% | Post-recession cuts |
| 2020s | 28% | Continued erosion |

### Trust Fund Cycles

UI trust funds follow predictable but problematic patterns:

1. **Boom**: Employment high, taxes accumulate
2. **Recession**: Claims rise, funds depleted
3. **Borrowing**: States borrow from federal fund
4. **Austerity**: States cut benefits, raise taxes to repay
5. **Repeat**: Cycle continues

### Political Economy

**Employer Influence**:

- Business groups consistently oppose expansion
- Experience rating creates incentive to contest claims
- Employer taxes fund system entirely
- Employer voice dominates in many states

**Worker Underrepresentation**:

- No worker contribution means less stake
- Unemployed workers not organized constituency
- Union decline reduced worker voice
- Stigma silences beneficiaries

## What History Teaches

### Design Flaws from Origin

The 1935 design embedded problems that persist:

1. **Federal-state structure**: Creates race to bottom
2. **Agricultural/domestic exclusions**: Racial exclusion legacy
3. **Employer-only funding**: Reduces worker stake
4. **State control of eligibility**: Enables restriction
5. **Experience rating**: Encourages claim contestation

### Erosion Pattern

UI coverage erodes in predictable ways:

- States reduce benefits/duration during fiscal stress
- Eligibility restrictions accumulate over time
- Work structure changes outpace program adaptation
- Federal standards provide floor but not adequacy

### Countercyclical Challenges

The system is least adequate when most needed:

- Trust funds depleted during recessions
- States cut benefits to restore solvency
- Extended Benefits triggers often not met
- Ad hoc federal intervention required

### Feasibility of Reform

History shows expansion is possible:

- 1970s coverage expansion succeeded
- Pandemic programs covered gig workers
- Other countries maintain broader, more adequate systems
- Political will is the binding constraint
