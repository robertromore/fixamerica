## Alternative Approaches

### Universal Basic Income Elements

**Regular Payments to All Adults**:

- Could replace UI for basic support
- UI would supplement during unemployment
- Removes categorical complexity
- Ensures floor for all

**Challenges**:

- Cost and political feasibility
- May not be adequate for job loss shock
- Integration with existing programs complex

### Wage Insurance

**Supplement Wages in New Lower-Paying Job**:

- Encourages faster return to work
- Compensates for wage loss
- Time-limited supplement
- May prevent skills atrophy

**Trade-offs**:

- Subsidizes low-wage employers
- May pressure workers into unsuitable jobs
- Administrative complexity
- Not substitute for adequate UI

### Short-Time Compensation (Work-Sharing)

**Reduce Hours Instead of Layoffs**:

- Workers keep jobs but reduced hours
- UI supplements lost wages
- Employer maintains trained workforce
- Germany's Kurzarbeit model

**Current Status**:

- Available in about half of states
- Underutilized by employers
- Proven effective in Germany
- Could be expanded significantly

### Portable Benefits

**Benefits Tied to Worker, Not Employer**:

- Contributions from all clients/platforms
- Pro-rated by hours or earnings
- Accessible regardless of classification
- Addresses gig worker exclusion

**Design Options**:

- Industry-based funds
- State-administered portable accounts
- Federal portable benefit system
- Platform contribution requirements

### Benefit Adequacy vs. Work Incentives

- Higher benefits may slightly extend duration
- But improve job match quality
