## Potential Allies

### Cross-Class Coalitions

**Middle-Class Workers**:

- Also face job insecurity
- Inadequate benefits affect all income levels
- Universal improvements benefit broadly

**Small Business**:

- Some harmed by unfair competition from misclassifiers
- Stable workforce beneficial
- May support fair playing field

### Issue Coalitions

**Racial Justice Movement**:

- UI disparities are racial equity issue
- History of deliberate exclusion
- Reform addresses structural racism

**Economic Justice**:

- UI is automatic stabilizer
- Benefits local economies
- Reduces poverty and hardship

**Gig Worker Rights**:

- Natural allies on coverage expansion
- Growing organization and voice
- Shared interest in classification reform

### Geographic Allies

**State-Level Reform Coalitions**:

- Progressive states can lead
- Demonstrations of effective reform
- Pressure on lagging states

## Strategic Implications

### Advantages for Reform

1. **Numbers**: Millions affected by inadequate UI
2. **Moral case**: Workers pay into system (through lower wages)
3. **Economic case**: UI benefits economy broadly
4. **Pandemic evidence**: Demonstrated system failures
5. **Racial equity**: Reform addresses historical wrongs

### Challenges for Reform

1. **Power imbalance**: Employers well-organized, workers not
2. **Federalism**: State-by-state battles required
3. **Narrative**: "Dependency" and "fraud" framing
4. **Stigma**: Beneficiaries reluctant to advocate
5. **Complexity**: Technical issues obscure stakes

### Building Power

**Short-Term**:

- Support specific campaigns in winnable states
- Document and publicize UI failures
- Build coalitions around pandemic lessons
- Elect reform-minded legislators

**Long-Term**:

- Organize gig and precarious workers
- Build narrative power (UI as insurance, not welfare)
- Campaign for federal minimum standards
- Address racial dimensions explicitly
