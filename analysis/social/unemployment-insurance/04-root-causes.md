# Unemployment Insurance: Root Causes

## Why Is UI Coverage Collapsing?

The decline in unemployment insurance recipiency from 50% to 28% reflects multiple reinforcing causes: structural program design flaws, deliberate policy restrictions, labor market transformation, and political economy dynamics that favor retrenchment.

## Structural Causes

### Federal-State Design

The joint federal-state structure creates inherent problems:

**Race to the Bottom**:

- States compete for business by reducing employer taxes
- Lower taxes require lower benefits or stricter eligibility
- No federal floor on benefit adequacy
- Employers can relocate to "cheaper" states

**Variation as Inequality**:

| Factor | Range Across States |
|--------|---------------------|
| Maximum weekly benefit | $235-$1,015 |
| Maximum duration | 12-28 weeks |
| Wage replacement rate | 30%-55% |
| Taxable wage base | $7,000-$62,500 |
| Recipiency rate | 10%-60% |

**Weak Federal Standards**:

- Federal law sets minimum conformity requirements only
- No federal floor on benefit levels
- No federal standards for eligibility
- FUTA provides incentive but not adequacy requirement

### Frozen Federal Parameters

**FUTA Wage Base Stagnation**:

- Frozen at $7,000 since 1983
- Average wage then: $16,000; now: $60,000+
- If indexed to wages: would be $50,000+
- Federal tax revenue declining in real terms

**Consequences**:

- Declining federal administrative funding
- Less capacity for system modernization
- Fewer resources for oversight
- States bear increasing burden

### Experience Rating Dynamics

**How It Works**:

Employers' UI tax rates vary based on their layoff history. More layoffs = higher rates.

**Intended Benefits**:

- Internalize cost of layoffs
- Reward employment stability
- Reduce opportunistic layoffs

**Perverse Effects**:

- Incentivizes contesting legitimate claims
- Creates asymmetric power in hearings
- Employers often represented; workers often not
- Discourages workers from filing

### Base Period Rigidity

**Standard Base Period Problem**:

- First four of last five completed calendar quarters
- Can exclude 6+ months of recent work
- Penalizes workers who recently found employment
- Creates gaps in coverage

**Alternative Base Period Solution**:

Many states have adopted ABP (most recent four quarters), but not universal.

## Policy-Driven Causes

### Eligibility Restrictions

States have progressively tightened eligibility:

**Monetary Requirements**:

- Higher minimum earnings thresholds
- More stringent high-quarter requirements
- More quarters of required employment
- Exclusion of low-wage workers

**Non-Monetary Restrictions**:

- Narrow definitions of "good cause" for quitting
- Broad definitions of "misconduct"
- Aggressive interpretation of "able and available"
- Rigid work search requirements

**Administrative Barriers**:

- Complex application processes
- Limited office hours and locations
- Inadequate online systems
- Verification requirements

### Duration Cuts

Several states reduced maximum duration after the Great Recession:

| State | Previous | Current | Reduction |
|-------|----------|---------|-----------|
| North Carolina | 26 weeks | 12-20 | 6-14 weeks |
| Florida | 26 weeks | 12-23 | 3-14 weeks |
| Georgia | 26 weeks | 14-20 | 6-12 weeks |
| Michigan | 26 weeks | 20 | 6 weeks |
| South Carolina | 26 weeks | 20 | 6 weeks |

### Work Search Enforcement

**Requirements Have Intensified**:

- More documented contacts required
- Narrower definition of suitable work
- Faster expectation to accept lower wages
- Digital monitoring expansion

**Impact**:

- Sanctions for technical violations
- Pressure to accept unsuitable work
- Administrative burden on claimants
- Deterrence of eligible workers

### Waiting Week Persistence

**Current Status**:

- 38 states require waiting week
- One week of unemployment with no benefits
- Reduces total support by 4-8%
- Delays income when most needed

## Labor Market Causes

### Rise of Gig and Non-Traditional Work

**Independent Contractor Classification**:

- ~16 million workers classified as independent contractors
- Generally ineligible for UI
- Many are economically dependent on single client
- Misclassification common

**Part-Time Work**:

- Many states require full-time work history
- Part-time workers may not meet hours requirements
- Work search for full-time work required
- Excludes workers with caregiving responsibilities

**Multiple Jobholders**:

- May not meet single-employer thresholds
- Wage combining across states complex
- Administrative burdens compound

### Workforce Churning

**Increased Job Instability**:

- Average job tenure declining
- More frequent transitions
- Base period may not capture stable employment
- New job may not provide UI credit before next separation

### New and Re-Entrants

**Workers Without History**:

- New labor force entrants lack base period earnings
- Re-entrants after caregiving lack recent history
- Immigrants may lack documented work history
- Students entering workforce excluded

## Political Economy Causes

### Employer Power

**Business Lobby Influence**:

- Employers fund system entirely, claim ownership
- Chamber of Commerce opposes expansion
- Experience-rated employers contest claims
- Legislative influence substantial

**Claim Contestation Industry**:

- Third-party firms specialize in denying claims
- Employers pay for representation at hearings
- Workers often unrepresented
- Asymmetric resources and information

### Anti-Worker Ideology

**"Dependency" Narrative**:

- Benefits framed as discouraging work
- Little evidence supports this for UI
- Ignores insurance function of program
- Justifies restrictions

**"Fraud" Narrative**:

- Exaggerates improper payments
- Pandemic fraud exploited for restriction arguments
- Ignores that most fraud is employer-side
- Justifies administrative barriers

### Racial Politics

**Deliberate Design**:

- 1935 exclusions targeted Black workers
- Southern states maintain strictest rules
- Correlation between Black population and program generosity (inverse)
- Racialized framing of beneficiaries

**Statistical Evidence**:

Research documents that states with larger Black populations have:

- Lower benefit levels
- Shorter duration
- Stricter eligibility
- Lower recipiency rates

### Federalism Exploitation

**State-Level Capture**:

- Easier for business to influence state legislatures
- Less national media scrutiny
- Race to bottom dynamics
- Federal government unable to mandate improvements

## Administrative Causes

### Antiquated Technology

**IT System Failures**:

- Many systems are 40+ years old
- COBOL-based, difficult to modify
- Crashed during pandemic surge
- Unable to implement new programs quickly

**Consequences**:

- Long processing delays
- High error rates
- Fraud vulnerability
- Poor claimant experience

### Underfunding

**Administrative Capacity Erosion**:

- Federal administrative grants declining
- Staff reductions in state agencies
- Training and development reduced
- Technology investment inadequate

**Impact**:

- Longer processing times
- More errors
- Less ability to adapt
- Degraded service quality

### Adjudication Problems

**Non-Monetary Determination Issues**:

- Overwhelmed adjudicators
- Inadequate investigation time
- Employer information prioritized
- Worker circumstances undervalued
