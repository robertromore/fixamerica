# Unemployment Insurance: Overview

Unemployment Insurance (UI) is a joint federal-state social insurance program designed to provide temporary income support to workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. Established during the Great Depression, UI serves as both a safety net for unemployed workers and an automatic economic stabilizer during recessions. However, the program has become increasingly inadequate, with only 28% of unemployed workers receiving benefits--the lowest recipiency rate in decades.
