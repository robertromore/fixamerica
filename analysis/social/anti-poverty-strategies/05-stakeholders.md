# Anti-Poverty Strategies: Stakeholders

## Overview

Anti-poverty strategies affect and involve a wide range of stakeholders, from the 38 million Americans living in poverty to policymakers, advocates, researchers, and those who benefit from or oppose change. Understanding who has stakes in anti-poverty policy--and what those stakes are--is essential for building effective coalitions and anticipating barriers to reform.
