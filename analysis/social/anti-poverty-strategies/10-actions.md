**Sample Message (CTC)**

> I urge you to make the expanded Child Tax Credit permanent. In 2021, this policy cut child poverty nearly in half, lifting 3.7 million children out of poverty. Its expiration caused child poverty to immediately double. We know how to dramatically reduce child poverty--we just need the political will. Please support permanent CTC expansion.

**Sample Message (Guaranteed Income)**

> I support guaranteed income programs and urge you to consider pilots in our community/state. Research from Stockton and other cities shows that cash transfers reduce poverty without reducing work, while improving mental health and financial stability. Please support evidence-based approaches to poverty reduction.
