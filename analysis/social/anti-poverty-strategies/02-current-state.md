# Anti-Poverty Strategies: Current State

## The Present Landscape

### Where We Stand Today

The United States is in a period of renewed experimentation and debate over anti-poverty strategies. The 2021 Child Tax Credit expansion demonstrated that bold policy can cut child poverty nearly in half, while its expiration showed that such gains are fragile without permanent institutionalization. Guaranteed income pilots are proliferating across American cities, generating new evidence on unconditional cash. Meanwhile, the traditional safety net remains fragmented, inadequate, and burdened by work requirements that evidence suggests are counterproductive.

**Key Current Statistics**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Poverty rate (Official) | 11.5% |
| Poverty rate (SPM) | 12.4% |
| People in poverty | 37.9 million |
| Child poverty rate | 16.3% |
| Deep poverty rate | 5.3% |
| Poverty gap (amount to eliminate poverty) | ~$175 billion |

## Guaranteed Income Pilots

### The Guaranteed Income Movement

Since 2019, a wave of guaranteed income pilots has swept across American cities, generating unprecedented evidence on unconditional cash transfers.

## Current Policy Debates

### Universal Basic Income Debate

**Arguments For UBI**

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Reduces poverty directly | Pilots show effectiveness |
| Dignified, no stigma | Universal, unconditional |
| Administrative simplicity | Lower bureaucracy |
| Enables work | Stockton, other pilots |
| Adapts to changing economy | Automation, gig work |

**Arguments Against UBI**

| Argument | Counterargument |
|----------|-----------------|
| Cost prohibitive | Net cost lower; replaces programs |
| Reduces work effort | Evidence says no |
| Inflation risk | Debated; depends on funding |
| Replaces targeted benefits | Can be additive |
| Political infeasibility | Growing momentum |

### Work Requirements Debate

**Current Status**

| Program | Work Requirements |
|---------|-------------------|
| TANF | Yes, mandatory |
| SNAP | Yes, for ABAWDs |
| Medicaid | Attempted in some states; mostly blocked |
| Housing | Some programs |

**Evidence on Work Requirements**

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| TANF research | No sustained employment gains |
| SNAP | Increased churn, not employment |
| Medicaid (Arkansas) | Massive coverage loss; no work increase |
| Administrative costs | Significant |

**Political Reality**: Work requirements remain popular despite lack of evidence for effectiveness.

### Means-Testing vs. Universality

**Current Trend**

| Direction | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Toward universality | Child allowance proposals, free school meals |
| Maintaining targeting | Political pressure on costs |
| Hybrid approaches | Universal with tax-back at high incomes |

## Federal Anti-Poverty Infrastructure

### Interagency Coordination

**Current State**

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Poverty reduction coordination | Limited |
| National anti-poverty strategy | None |
| Poverty goal-setting | No federal targets |
| Cross-agency data sharing | Improving slowly |
| Unified application | Piloted but not scaled |

### Poverty Measurement

**Current Measures**

| Measure | Use |
|---------|-----|
| Official Poverty Measure (OPM) | Primary; eligibility for some programs |
| Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) | Research; better captures reality |
| Material hardship measures | Limited use |

**Measurement Issues**

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| OPM outdated | Undercounts poverty |
| SPM not used for eligibility | Creates disconnect |
| No quarterly data | Slow to detect changes |
| Geographic adjustment | Limited in OPM |

## State and Local Innovation

### State Anti-Poverty Strategies

**States with Explicit Poverty Reduction Goals**

| State | Approach |
|-------|----------|

| Santa Clara County, CA | Universal basic income pilot |
| Jackson, MS | Magnolia Mother's Trust (mothers in poverty) |

## Philanthropic and Private Sector

### Major Funders of Anti-Poverty Research

| Funder | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| Gates Foundation | Global poverty; domestic increasingly |
| Robert Wood Johnson Foundation | Health equity, social determinants |
| Ford Foundation | Economic security |
| Open Society Foundations | Guaranteed income |
