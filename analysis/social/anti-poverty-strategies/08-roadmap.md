# Anti-Poverty Strategies: Roadmap

## Overview

Transforming America's approach to poverty reduction requires a strategic, phased approach that builds political support, generates evidence, and sequences reforms for maximum impact. This roadmap outlines pathways from current conditions to a comprehensive anti-poverty strategy, recognizing that different political scenarios will enable different levels of ambition.
