# Anti-Poverty Strategies: Opposition

## Overview

Opposition to anti-poverty strategies comes from multiple sources: ideological conservatives who believe government intervention is harmful, fiscal hawks concerned about costs and debt, employers who fear labor market effects, and those who genuinely believe work requirements and time limits help recipients. Understanding these opposition arguments--and the evidence regarding their validity--is essential for building effective counter-strategies and identifying areas of potential compromise.

## Categories of Opposition

### Ideological Opposition

**Limited Government Conservatives**

| Argument | Counterpoint |
|----------|--------------|
| Government programs don't work | EITC, CTC, SNAP reduce poverty |
| Create dependency | Evidence doesn't support |
| Crowd out private charity | Private charity insufficient |
| Undermine personal responsibility | Ignores structural causes |
| Socialism | Programs in all democracies |

**Libertarian Position**

| Argument | Counterpoint |
|----------|--------------|
| Coercive redistribution | Poverty is also coercive |
| Violates property rights | Democratic decisions legitimate |
| Market solutions superior | Markets haven't solved poverty |
| UBI might be acceptable | Some libertarians support |

### Fiscal Opposition

**Deficit/Debt Concerns**

| Argument | Counterpoint |
|----------|--------------|
| Can't afford expansion | Poverty costs $1 trillion+; elimination costs $175B |
| Unsustainable spending | Choose to spend on other things |
| Future generations pay | Child poverty costs future generations |
| Inflation risk | Debated; depends on funding |

**Tax Opposition**

| Argument | Counterpoint |
|----------|--------------|
| Taxes hurt economy | Evidence mixed; depends on design |
| Tax burden too high | U.S. taxes lower than most peers |
| Redistribution unfair | Concentrated wealth also unfair |
| Punishes success | Progressive taxes fund opportunity |

### Work Ethic Arguments

**"Work Requirements Work"**

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Require work to receive benefits | Research shows no employment increase |
| Teach responsibility | Cause churn, not employment |
| Taxpayers expect it | Administrative burden, not results |
| Distinguish deserving/undeserving | Most poor already work or can't |

**"Cash Discourages Work"**

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Free money reduces effort | NIT experiments: minor reduction |
| People will stop working | Stockton: employment increased |
| Must require work | EITC works; so does unconditional |
| Creates dependency | No evidence of long-term dependency |

### Moral/Cultural Arguments

**"Poverty Is Personal Failure"**

| Argument | Reality |
|----------|---------|
| Poor make bad choices | Structural factors dominate |
| Lack of effort | Most poor work or can't |
| Cultural factors | Economic factors more important |
| If I made it, anyone can | Survivor bias |

**"Benefits Enable Bad Behavior"**

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Cash spent on drugs/alcohol | Research shows necessities |
| Enables irresponsibility | No evidence of harm |
| Should be in-kind | Cash more efficient, dignified |
| Need paternalistic guidance | Poor make reasonable choices |

## Opposition Arguments in Detail

### Against Universal Basic Income

**"Too Expensive"**

| Claim | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| $12,000/year x 250M adults = $3T | Net cost much lower with phase-outs |
| Would require massive taxes | Can replace some programs |
| Unsustainable | Depends on design, funding |

**Response**: Net cost with phase-outs closer to $1T or less; can be funded through tax reform; other countries spend more on social programs as share of GDP.

**"Reduces Work Incentive"**

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Free money = stop working | NIT experiments: 1-5% hour reduction |
| People are lazy | Most people want to work |
| Creates dependency | No long-term evidence |

**Response**: Pilots show employment increases or no change; work reduction was mainly secondary earners (mothers) choosing family time; people work for meaning, not just money.

**"Inflation Risk"**

| Claim | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| More money = higher prices | Depends on funding mechanism |
| Would be eaten by inflation | Not if funded by taxes |
| Supply constraints | Gradual implementation mitigates |

**Response**: If funded by taxes (redistribution), no net demand increase; Alaska PFD hasn't caused inflation; depends on implementation.

**"Replaces Targeted Programs"**

| Claim | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Would eliminate SNAP, housing | Can be additive |
| Less for poorest | Design choice |
| One-size-fits-all | Can combine with targeted |

**Response**: Can be designed as supplement; floor not ceiling; need not eliminate categorical programs.

### Against Child Allowance/Expanded CTC

**"Too Costly"**

| Claim | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| $100B+ per year | ROI of 7:1 or higher |
| Adds to deficit | Child poverty costs $1T annually |
| Can't afford it | Policy choice |

**Response**: Investment with strong returns; long-term savings in healthcare, crime, productivity; other countries afford it.

**"Work Disincentive"**

| Claim | 2021 Evidence |
|-------|---------------|
| Fully refundable = no work | Employment did not decline |
| Pays people not to work | Poorest children need most help |
| Should require earnings | Children not responsible for parents |

**Response**: 2021 expansion showed no work reduction; children are blameless; work requirements exclude poorest children.

**"Rewards Irresponsible Parenting"**

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Encourages having children | No evidence of fertility effects |
| Pays for bad choices | Children need support regardless |
| Moral hazard | Other countries have allowances; not a problem |

**Response**: All wealthy nations have child allowances without fertility effects; children should not be punished for parents.

### Against Baby Bonds

**"Government Picking Winners"**

| Claim | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Unfair to give some more | Addressing unfair birth lottery |
| Wealthy don't need it | Phase to zero at high income |
| Should save themselves | Wealth gap prevents |

**Response**: Progressive design gives more to poorest; addresses structural wealth gap; universal element builds support.

**"Will Be Wasted"**

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| 18-year-olds will waste it | Restricted uses (education, home, business) |
| No financial literacy | Include education component |
| Premature access | Age-restricted |

**Response**: Restricted uses; financial education can accompany; evidence from CSAs shows responsible use.

### Against Jobs Guarantee

**"Government Can't Create Productive Jobs"**

| Claim | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Make-work | Many unmet public needs |
| Bureaucratic | Design challenges real but addressable |
| Displacement | Private sector jobs prioritized |

**Response**: Infrastructure, caregiving, environment need workers; can be designed well; complements private sector.

**"Too Expensive"**

| Claim | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Gross cost high | Net cost lower (reduced safety net, tax revenue) |
| Would require massive taxes | Depends on scale, design |
| Inflation risk | Wage floor, not unlimited |

**Response**: Gross vs. net cost distinction; unemployed costly too; can be designed to minimize inflation.

**"Crowds Out Private Sector"**

| Claim | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Government competes with business | Set wage at floor |
| Workers won't take private jobs | Private can pay more |
| Distorts labor market | Addresses market failure |

**Response**: Designed as employer of last resort; private sector must pay living wage; addresses involuntary unemployment.

### Against National Anti-Poverty Strategy

**"Goals Without Enforcement Are Meaningless"**

| Claim | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Aspirational only | UK showed goals drive action |
| No consequences | Accountability matters |
| Symbolic | Symbolism shapes behavior |

**"Government Can't Solve Poverty"**

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| War on Poverty failed | Cut poverty significantly |
| Dependency | Programs reduced poverty |
| Market solutions | Markets haven't solved it |

**Response**: Government programs dramatically reduce poverty; other countries have much lower rates with more government.
