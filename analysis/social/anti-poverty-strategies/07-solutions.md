# Anti-Poverty Strategies: Solutions

## Overview

Poverty in America is solvable. The 2021 Child Tax Credit expansion cut child poverty nearly in half in a single year. Canada's Child Benefit reduced child poverty by 30%. The UK halved child poverty between 1999-2010 through explicit targets and comprehensive policy. These are not theoretical possibilities--they are demonstrated results. This document presents the major evidence-based anti-poverty strategies available, from income guarantees to asset-building to comprehensive frameworks.
