# Anti-Poverty Strategies: Overview

## Executive Summary

The United States has the resources, knowledge, and capability to dramatically reduce poverty. The question is whether we choose to do so. Evidence-based anti-poverty strategies--from Universal Basic Income (UBI) to child allowances to baby bonds--have been tested, researched, and implemented successfully both domestically and internationally. The 2021 expanded Child Tax Credit cut child poverty nearly in half in a single year. Canada's Child Benefit reduced child poverty by 30%. The UK's explicit child poverty targets halved child poverty between 1999-2010. These are not theoretical proposals; they are proven interventions.

The annual cost of poverty to the United States exceeds $1 trillion through lost productivity, increased healthcare costs, and criminal justice expenses. By contrast, closing the poverty gap--the aggregate amount needed to bring all poor Americans to the poverty line--would cost approximately $175-200 billion annually. We spend more suffering from poverty than it would cost to eliminate it.

The core policy debate centers on several fundamental questions: Should anti-poverty policy focus on income support or work requirements? On universal programs or targeted benefits? On prevention or amelioration? On cash or in-kind assistance? Different strategies embody different answers to these questions, from the work-focused Earned Income Tax Credit to the universal child allowances common in Europe to the unconditional cash transfers being piloted in cities across America.

## Key Concepts

### Universal vs. Targeted

**Universal Programs**

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Everyone eligible | No stigma |
| Simple administration | Lower costs |
| Political durability | Broad support |
| Full coverage | No gaps |
| Examples | Social Security, Medicare, child allowances |

**Targeted Programs**

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Limited to poor | Lower total cost |
| More per recipient | Higher benefit |
| Means-tested | Resources to neediest |
| Downsides | Stigma, complexity, cliffs |
| Examples | TANF, SNAP, Medicaid |

**The Paradox of Targeting**

Programs targeted to the poor tend to be poor programs:
- Less political support
- More stigma
- More administrative burden
- More prone to cuts

### Cash vs. In-Kind

**Cash Transfers**

| Advantage | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| Fungible | Families choose needs |
| Dignified | Respects autonomy |
| Efficient | Low administration |
| Stimulative | Spent in local economy |

**In-Kind Benefits**

| Advantage | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| Ensures specific use | Food, housing, healthcare |
| May be more politically viable | "Not for drugs" |
| Addresses market failures | Healthcare especially |
| Can ensure quality | Housing standards |

**Evidence**: Research shows cash is generally as effective or more effective than in-kind, with no evidence of widespread misuse.

### Prevention vs. Amelioration

**Prevention** (Upstream)

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Ensure good jobs | Minimum wage, labor standards |
| Build human capital | Education, training |
| Prevent shocks | Paid leave, insurance |
| Address root causes | Discrimination, structural barriers |

**Amelioration** (Downstream)

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Income support | TANF, SSI, EITC |
| In-kind assistance | SNAP, Medicaid |
| Emergency help | LIHEAP, emergency assistance |
| Service provision | Case management |

**Both are needed**: Prevention reduces poverty creation; amelioration addresses existing poverty.

### Work Requirements

**The Debate**

| Pro-Work Requirements | Anti-Work Requirements |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Encourage work | Already working or can't |
| Taxpayer support | Administrative burden |
| "Responsibility" | Punish children for parents |
| Political support | Evidence of ineffectiveness |

**Evidence on Work Requirements**

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Do not increase employment | Multiple studies |
| Do increase administrative churn | CMS, academic research |
| Do cause benefit loss | SNAP, Medicaid data |
| Do not increase earnings | TANF evaluations |

### Place-Based Strategies

**Concentrated Poverty Problem**

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Persistent poverty counties | 20%+ poverty for 30+ years |
| Neighborhood effects | Poverty compounds in place |
| Limited opportunity | Jobs, services scarce |
| Disinvestment spiral | Tax base erodes |

**Place-Based Solutions**

| Strategy | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Economic development | Opportunity Zones, EDA |
| Infrastructure investment | Broadband, transportation |
| Anchor institutions | Hospitals, universities |
| Community development | CDFIs, CDCs |
