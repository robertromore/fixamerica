# Anti-Poverty Strategies: History

## Overview

Anti-poverty policy in America has cycled through periods of ambition and retrenchment, reflecting broader political and economic shifts. From the Progressive Era's settlement houses through the War on Poverty to welfare reform and beyond, the nation has experimented with a wide range of approaches--work-based incentives, direct cash assistance, in-kind programs, asset-building, and comprehensive strategies. Understanding this history is essential to grasping current debates and charting effective paths forward.
