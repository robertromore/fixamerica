# Anti-Poverty Strategies: Overview

The United States has the resources, knowledge, and capability to dramatically reduce poverty. The question is whether we choose to do so. Evidence-based anti-poverty strategies--from Universal Basic Income (UBI) to child allowances to baby bonds--have been tested, researched, and implemented successfully both domestically and internationally. The 2021 expanded Child Tax Credit cut child poverty nearly in half in a single year. Canada's Child Benefit reduced child poverty by 30%. The UK's explicit child poverty targets halved child poverty between 1999-2010. These are not theoretical proposals; they are proven interventions.
