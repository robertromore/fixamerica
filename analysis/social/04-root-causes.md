# Social: Root Causes

## Overview

America's inadequate safety net results from a complex interaction of structural, economic, political, and cultural factors. The nation's federal system, racial politics, and ideological individualism combine to produce a uniquely fragmented approach to social protection. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing reforms that address not just symptoms but the underlying dynamics that perpetuate poverty and program inadequacy. The causes operate at multiple levels and reinforce each other, creating a system that is difficult to fundamentally change.

## Structural Causes

### Federalism and State Variation

| Factor | How It Creates Problems |
|--------|------------------------|
| **State administration** | Creates 50+ different systems |
| **Block grant design** | States can divert funds from assistance |
| **No federal floors** | Benefit adequacy varies wildly |
| **Race to the bottom** | States compete by offering less |
| **Preemption battles** | Federal-state conflicts |
| **Historical origins** | Built to accommodate segregation |

### Program Design Flaws

| Flaw | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Categorical eligibility** | Must fit narrow definitions |
| **Multiple programs** | Fragmentation, gaps, cliffs |
| **Time limits** | Arbitrary cutoffs regardless of need |
| **Asset limits** | Penalize savings, stability |
| **Income cliffs** | Lose entire benefits at thresholds |
| **Work requirements** | Create barriers, not employment |

### Administrative Barriers

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Application complexity** | Discourages participation |
| **Documentation requirements** | Excludes those without papers |
| **Recertification burdens** | Causes churning |
| **Office accessibility** | Physical and time barriers |
| **Technology failures** | Outdated, dysfunctional systems |
| **Caseworker discretion** | Inconsistent, biased decisions |

### Insurance vs. Assistance Divide

| Feature | Social Insurance | Means-Tested |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| **Political support** | Strong (earned) | Weak (handout) |
| **Coverage** | Near-universal | Targeted |
| **Benefits** | Adequate | Inadequate |
| **Administration** | Federal, simple | State, complex |
| **Examples** | Social Security, Medicare | TANF, SNAP |
| **Racial coding** | "Our" programs | "Their" programs |

---

## Economic Causes

### Labor Market Failures

| Factor | Impact on Poverty |
|--------|------------------|
| **Low wages** | Full-time work doesn't lift families from poverty |
| **Wage stagnation** | 40+ years of flat wages for bottom half |
| **Job instability** | Gig work, temp jobs, no benefits |
| **Underemployment** | Can't get enough hours |
| **Automation risk** | Displacement without transition support |
| **Monopsony** | Employer power suppresses wages |

### Cost Burdens

| Cost | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Housing** | 50%+ of income for poor families |
| **Healthcare** | Catastrophic costs, medical debt |
| **Child care** | $10,000+/year, unaffordable |
| **Transportation** | Car dependency, high costs |
| **Education** | Debt burden, credential requirements |
| **Food** | Rising costs, benefit insufficiency |

### Wealth Inequality

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Asset poverty** | No buffer for emergencies |
| **Intergenerational transfer** | Poverty passed down |
| **Housing discrimination** | Blocked from wealth-building |
| **Predatory finance** | Extraction from poor communities |
| **Credit access** | Expensive or unavailable |
| **Retirement gap** | No savings, inadequate pensions |

### Economic Volatility

| Source | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Recessions** | Safety net doesn't expand adequately |
| **Income volatility** | Monthly swings destabilize families |
| **Job loss** | UI inadequate, TANF inaccessible |
| **Health shocks** | Financial catastrophe |
| **Family changes** | Divorce, death create crises |

---

## Political Causes

### Racial Politics

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Racialized stereotypes** | "Welfare queen" narrative |

| **Dog whistle messaging** | Coded racial appeals |
| **Spatial segregation** | Undermines solidarity |
| **Voter suppression** | Reduces poor people's voice |
| **Criminalization of poverty** | Fines, fees, incarceration |

### Interest Group Imbalance

| Group | Political Power | Position |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **Poor people** | Minimal | Disorganized, low turnout |
| **Anti-poverty advocates** | Moderate | Outspent, outmanned |
| **Business lobby** | High | Opposes labor standards, taxes |
| **Anti-welfare groups** | High | Well-funded, organized |
| **State officials** | High | Want flexibility, less spending |

### Bipartisan Consensus Against Welfare

| Era | Dynamic |
|-----|---------|
| **1970s-1980s** | Rising criticism from both parties |
| **1990s** | Clinton "end welfare as we know it" |
| **2000s** | Bipartisan work requirements expansion |
| **2010s** | Deficit politics constrain expansion |
| **2020s** | CTC expansion couldn't be sustained |

### Electoral Incentives

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Non-voting poor** | Politicians ignore |
| **Suburban focus** | Programs for "deserving" middle class |
| **Anti-tax sentiment** | Revenue constraints |
| **Short-term horizons** | Long-term poverty reduction undervalued |
| **Donor influence** | Wealthy preferences dominate |

### Institutional Barriers

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Filibuster** | Blocks major legislation |
| **State legislatures** | Often hostile to expansion |
| **Judicial challenges** | Courts strike down programs |
| **Administrative constraints** | Executive action limited |
| **Constitutional limits** | Federal spending power interpreted narrowly |

## Cultural Causes

| **Working poor** | EITC but not cash |
| **Unemployed** | Temporary help only |
| **Non-working adults** | "Undeserving" - minimal support |

### Anti-Government Sentiment

| Belief | Effect |
|--------|--------|

| **Programs don't work** | Defund, don't improve |
| **Private charity better** | Voluntary over mandatory |

| **Employment as citizenship** | Benefits tied to work |
| **Unpaid care devalued** | Caregivers excluded |
| **Disability skepticism** | Onerous qualification |
