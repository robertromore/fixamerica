# Social: Stakeholders

## Overview

The social safety net involves a complex web of stakeholders with varying interests, power, and positions on reform. Those who experience poverty have the most at stake but the least political power. Program administrators, service providers, and advocacy organizations occupy a middle ground. Elected officials, business interests, and ideological opponents hold disproportionate influence. Understanding these dynamics is essential for building coalitions and developing strategies to expand and improve the safety net.
