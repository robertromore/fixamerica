# Poverty: Solutions

## Overview

Poverty in America is a policy choice. Other wealthy nations achieve far lower poverty rates through a combination of labor market interventions, income support, and public services. The solutions exist; the question is whether we choose to implement them. This document presents a comprehensive framework for reducing and ultimately eliminating poverty.

## Framework for Solutions

### Three-Legged Stool

Effective poverty reduction requires action on three fronts:

## Labor Market Solutions

### Raise the Minimum Wage

**The Case**

- Federal minimum wage has lost 40%+ of purchasing power since 1968
- Full-time minimum wage work leaves families in poverty
- States with higher minimum wages have lower poverty

**Proposal: $17 Federal Minimum by 2028**

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Target wage | $17/hour by 2028 |
| Phase-in | Annual increases from current level |
| Indexing | Annual adjustment for median wage growth |
| Tipped minimum | Eliminate; one fair wage |
| Youth subminimum | Eliminate |
| Local preemption | Prohibit state preemption of local wages |

**Impact**

- Would raise wages for 33+ million workers
- Would reduce poverty by 1-2 percentage points
- States show minimal job losses at higher wages

### Improve Job Quality

**Key Elements**

| Policy | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Predictable scheduling | Advance notice, right to request, no on-call |
| Paid leave | Universal paid family and medical leave |
| Benefits access | Portable benefits, pro-rata for part-time |
| Classification | Crack down on misclassification |
| Overtime | Raise salary threshold for exemption |

**Proposal: Fair Scheduling Act**

- 2 weeks advance notice of schedules
- Premium pay for short-notice changes
- Right to request schedule modifications
- No retaliation for requests

**Proposal: National Paid Leave**

- 12 weeks paid family and medical leave
- Wage replacement at 80%+ for low-wage workers
- Covers all workers, including self-employed
- Funded through small payroll contribution

### Strengthen Worker Power

**The Labor Movement Connection**

| Union Status | Impact on Poverty |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Union workers | 10-20% higher wages |
| Non-union in high-union areas | Wages lifted by standard |
| Weak union areas | Wages lower |

**Proposal: PRO Act and Beyond**

| Element | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Card check recognition | Easier organizing |
| Ban captive audience meetings | Reduce employer coercion |
| Sectoral bargaining | Industry-wide standards |
| Strengthen penalties | Real consequences for violations |
| Portable benefits | Coverage across employers |

### Full Employment

**Why Full Employment Matters**

- Tight labor markets raise wages at bottom
- Reduces discrimination (employers can't be picky)
- Increases hours for those wanting more
- Best anti-poverty program

**Proposal: Federal Job Guarantee**

| Element | Design |
|---------|--------|
| Wage | $15/hour minimum, living wage for area |
| Benefits | Health, retirement, leave |
| Work | Community service, infrastructure, care |
| Automatic | Countercyclical; expands in recession |
| Local administration | Community-based |

**Alternative: Strong Full Employment Policy**

- Federal Reserve prioritize employment equally with inflation
- Aggressive fiscal policy in downturns
- Direct job creation in persistent poverty areas
- Investment in infrastructure, care economy

## Income Support Solutions

### Expand the Child Tax Credit

**2021 Proved the Case**

| Metric | Before | With Expanded CTC |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Child poverty rate | 9.7% | 5.2% |
| Children in poverty | 7 million | 3.8 million |

**Proposal: Permanent CTC Expansion**

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Amount | $3,600/child under 6, $3,000 ages 6-17 |
| Refundability | Fully refundable (reaches all children) |
| Payment | Monthly advance option |
| Phase-out | Begins at $400,000 (joint filers) |
| Index | Annual adjustment for inflation |

**Impact**

- Would lift 3+ million children out of poverty
- Would reduce child poverty by 40%+
- Would reach poorest families (unlike prior CTC)

### Expand the Earned Income Tax Credit

**Current EITC Gaps**

| Gap | Problem |
|-----|---------|
| Childless workers | Maximum $600 vs. $7,430 with 3 children |
| Age limits | 25-64 for childless |
| Low-income students | Often ineligible |
| Non-custodial parents | Often ineligible |

**Proposal: Expanded EITC**

| Element | Change |
|---------|--------|
| Childless maximum | Increase to $3,000 |
| Age | 18+ (include younger workers) |
| Students | Include |
| Non-custodial parents | Include with child support |
| Minimum wage interaction | Bonus for workers at minimum wage |

### Reform TANF

**Current TANF Failure**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Families served | 21% of poor families (down from 68%) |
| Block grant value | Eroded 40%+ since 1996 (not indexed) |
| Median benefit | $492/month (29% of poverty) |
| Work participation | Often not achieved; sanctions common |

**Proposal: TANF Reform**

| Element | Change |
|---------|--------|
| Entitlement | Restore right to assistance |
| Indexing | Index block grant to inflation and caseload |
| Benefit floor | Minimum 50% of poverty |
| Time limits | Remove or extend substantially |
| Work requirements | Remove or make supportive (provide jobs) |
| State accountability | Require poverty reduction, not caseload reduction |

### Create a Child Allowance

**Beyond the CTC: Universal Child Benefit**

| Element | Design |
|---------|--------|
| Amount | $300-500/month per child |
| Universality | All children; phase-out at high income |
| Payment | Monthly, to caregiver |
| Simplicity | No application; automatic at birth |

**International Models**

| Country | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Canada | Canada Child Benefit: ~$500/month average |
| Germany | Kindergeld: ~$250/month |
| UK | Child Benefit: ~$100-170/month |

**Impact**

| Duration | 3 years minimum for evaluation |
| Scale | Multiple cities, diverse populations |
| Evaluation | Rigorous study of impacts |

## Service and Support Solutions

### Universal Healthcare

**Healthcare-Poverty Connection**

- Medical costs: leading cause of bankruptcy
- Medicaid cliff: lose coverage at low income
- Uninsured: postpone care, face catastrophic costs
- Work-health link: job determines coverage

**Proposal: Medicare for All or Public Option**

| Approach | Impact on Poverty |
|----------|-------------------|
| Medicare for All | Eliminate medical costs; reduce poverty 2%+ |
| Public Option | Reduce costs; partial poverty reduction |
| Medicaid expansion (all states) | Cover 2+ million; reduce poverty |
| ACA fix | Improve subsidies; reduce underinsurance |

### Universal Childcare

**Childcare-Poverty Connection**

- Childcare costs: $10,000-15,000+/year
- Poor families: 30%+ of income on care
- Care quality: affects child development
- Maternal employment: depends on care access

**Proposal: Universal Childcare**

| Element | Design |
|---------|--------|
| Cost to families | Capped at 7% of income |
| Subsidy | Sliding scale to median income |
| Free for poor | No cost below poverty |
| Quality | Staffing ratios, training, wages |
| Access | Guarantee availability |

**Impact**

- Would enable work
- Would reduce family costs
- Would improve child development
- Would raise care worker wages

### Housing Assistance

**Housing-Poverty Connection**

- Rent burden: 46% of renters pay 30%+ for housing
- Severe burden: 24% pay 50%+
- Crowding, instability, homelessness result
- Housing costs drive poverty in high-cost areas

**Proposal: Universal Housing Vouchers**

| Element | Design |
|---------|--------|
| Eligibility | All households below 50% AMI |
| Standard | 30% of income for housing |
| Portability | Usable anywhere |
| Supply | Pair with construction programs |

**Alternative: Major Housing Investments**

- Connections to wrap-around services

**Proposal: Free Community College**

- Tuition-free community college
- Stipends for low-income students
- Childcare and transportation support

## Targeted Interventions

### Deep Poverty Focus

**Why Deep Poverty Requires Special Attention**

- 18 million in deep poverty
- Often disconnected from programs
- Multiple, severe barriers
- Standard programs may not reach

**Proposal: Deep Poverty Intervention**

| Element | Design |
|---------|--------|
| Outreach | Active; meet people where they are |
| Benefits | Accessible; reduce administrative burden |
| Cash | Emergency cash assistance |
| Services | Intensive case management |
| Housing | Rapid rehousing, prevention |

### Place-Based Strategies

**Persistent Poverty Areas**

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Economic development | Appalachian Regional Commission model |
| Infrastructure | Broadband, water, transit |
| Anchor institutions | Hospital, university investment |
| Workforce | Training tied to jobs |
| Capital access | Community development finance |

**Proposal: Persistent Poverty County Initiative**

- Concentrated federal investment
- 10-year commitment
- Community-led planning
- Accountability for outcomes
- Address historical injustice

### Family Structure Supports

**Supporting All Families**

| Need | Policy |
|------|--------|
| Co-parenting | Child support reform |
| Work-family balance | Paid leave, flexible work |
| Relationship stability | Voluntary programs |
| Marriage penalty removal | Tax/benefit reform |

**Note**: Focus on support, not marriage promotion; respect diverse families.

## Policy Integration

### Addressing the Benefits Cliff

**The Problem**

- Earning more can mean losing more in benefits
- Marginal tax rates exceed 100% at some points
- Discourages advancement

**Solution: Gradual Phase-Outs**

| Program | Reform |
|---------|--------|
| Medicaid | Gradual phase-out (not cliff) |
| Housing | Gradual rent increases |
| Childcare | Sliding scale to median income |
| SNAP | Already has gradual phase-out |
| EITC | Already has gradual phase-out |

**Solution: Coordination**

- Single application for multiple programs
- Coordinated phase-outs
- Real-time eligibility (reduce churn)

### Updating the Poverty Measure

**Problems with Current Measure**

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Outdated formula | Understates poverty |
| No geographic adjustment | Misses high-cost area poverty |
| Cash only | Misses non-cash benefits |
| Arbitrary | Not tied to actual needs |

**Proposal: Modernized Poverty Measure**

- Replace OPM with SPM as official measure
- Or develop new measure based on actual costs
- Annual geographic adjustment
- Count all income and benefits
- Measure at subcounty level

## International Models

### What Works Abroad

| Country | Approach | Child Poverty Rate |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Denmark | Universal benefits, quality jobs | 3.7% |
| Finland | Strong safety net, services | 3.5% |
| Germany | Family benefits, labor market | 8.0% |
| Canada | Canada Child Benefit | 8.1% |
| UK | Universal Credit (with problems) | 11.0% |
| **US** | **Weak safety net** | **15.7%** |

### Key Lessons

1. **Universal benefits work**: Not just targeted to poor
2. **Child benefits effective**: Direct payments reduce child poverty
3. **Services matter**: Healthcare, childcare reduce costs
4. **Labor market matters**: Good jobs, unions, minimum wage
5. **Political will is key**: Other countries chose lower poverty
