# Poverty: Overview

## Executive Summary

Nearly 38 million Americans live in poverty, including one in six children. Despite being the world's wealthiest nation, the United States has among the highest poverty rates of developed countries. Poverty in America is not merely a lack of income; it is a systemic condition that limits opportunity, shortens lives, undermines child development, and perpetuates disadvantage across generations.

The official poverty measure, unchanged in its methodology since the 1960s, significantly undercounts economic hardship by failing to account for modern expenses like childcare, healthcare, and geographic cost variations. The Supplemental Poverty Measure reveals that millions more Americans struggle to meet basic needs. Deep poverty--living at less than half the poverty line--affects 18 million people, including 5 million children.

Poverty disproportionately affects children, people of color, single-parent families, people with disabilities, and residents of both urban cores and rural areas. The working poor--millions who work full-time but cannot escape poverty--reveal that the problem is structural, not simply individual. Intergenerational poverty transmission means that for millions of Americans, birth circumstances largely determine life outcomes.

## The Core Problem

### Measuring Poverty

**Official Poverty Measure (OPM)**

The federal poverty line, developed in the 1960s, is based on three times the cost of a minimal food budget. For 2024:

| Family Size | Poverty Threshold |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 person | $15,060 |
| 2 people | $20,440 |
| 3 people | $25,820 |
| 4 people | $31,200 |

**Problems with the OPM**

- Based on 1960s spending patterns (food was 1/3 of budget)
- Does not account for geographic cost differences
- Ignores childcare, healthcare, transportation costs
- Does not count most non-cash benefits
- Does not account for taxes paid or credits received

**Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM)**

The SPM, developed in 2011, provides a more complete picture by:

- Counting government benefits (SNAP, housing assistance)
- Subtracting taxes, work expenses, medical costs
- Adjusting for geographic cost of living
- Using updated consumption data

| Measure | 2022 Poverty Rate |
|---------|-------------------|
| Official (OPM) | 11.5% |
| Supplemental (SPM) | 12.4% |

The SPM shows:
- Higher elderly poverty (medical costs)
- Lower child poverty (safety net counted)
- Major geographic variation

### Who Is Poor

**2022 Official Poverty Rates by Group**

| Group | Poverty Rate |
|-------|--------------|
| **Overall** | 11.5% |
| Children (under 18) | 16.3% |
| Adults 18-64 | 10.5% |
| Elderly (65+) | 10.3% |
| White (non-Hispanic) | 8.6% |
| Black | 19.5% |
| Hispanic | 17.1% |
| Asian | 10.0% |
| Married-couple families | 5.0% |
| Female-headed families | 26.3% |

**By the Numbers (2022)**

- 37.9 million people in poverty
- 11.6 million children in poverty
- 5.3% in deep poverty (below 50% of poverty line)
- 17.8 million in deep poverty

### Types of Poverty

**Transitional Poverty**
- Temporary poverty due to job loss, divorce, illness
- Most common form; many exit within 2 years
- Safety net critical during transitions

**Persistent Poverty**
- Poverty lasting multiple years
- More common in certain communities and families
- Harder to escape; requires sustained intervention

**Deep Poverty**
- Income below 50% of poverty threshold
- Approximately $7,500 for individual
- 5.3% of population (18+ million people)
- Most severe deprivation; highest barriers

**Near Poverty**
- Income 100-200% of poverty line
- 29% of population
- "ALICE" households (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed)
- Face many same hardships as poor; ineligible for many programs

### The Working Poor

**Myth vs. Reality**

Myth: The poor don't work
Reality: Millions of workers remain poor

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Workers in poverty | 6.3 million |
| Working families in poverty | 6.9 million |
| Full-time workers below poverty | 1.3 million |
| Part-time workers due to lack of full-time work | 4.2 million |

**Why Work Doesn't Lift All Out of Poverty**

- Minimum wage ($7.25 federal) below poverty line for family
- Part-time and irregular schedules
- Lack of benefits (healthcare, paid leave)
- High childcare costs consume income
- Transportation and work expenses

## By the Numbers

### Poverty Trends

| Year | Official Rate | People in Poverty |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1960 | 22.2% | 39.9 million |
| 1970 | 12.6% | 25.4 million |
| 1980 | 13.0% | 29.3 million |
| 1990 | 13.5% | 33.6 million |
| 2000 | 11.3% | 31.1 million |
| 2010 | 15.1% | 46.2 million |
| 2019 | 10.5% | 34.0 million |
| 2021 (with expanded CTC) | 7.8% | 25.6 million |
| 2022 | 11.5% | 37.9 million |

### Child Poverty

| Metric | Rate |
|--------|------|
| Official child poverty rate | 16.3% |
| SPM child poverty rate | 12.4% |
| Deep child poverty | 5.1% |
| Children in near-poverty (100-200% FPL) | 21% |
| 2021 rate (expanded CTC) | 5.2% |

### Geographic Distribution

**Persistent Poverty Counties** (poverty rate 20%+ for 30+ years)

| Region | Number of Counties |
|--------|-------------------|
| Deep South | 205 |
| Appalachia | 98 |
| Rio Grande Valley | 48 |
| Native American lands | 62 |
| **Total** | 413 |

**Urban vs. Rural**

| Area Type | Poverty Rate |
|-----------|--------------|
| Principal cities | 14.2% |
| Metropolitan suburbs | 8.9% |
| Non-metropolitan areas | 14.0% |

### International Comparison

| Country | Poverty Rate (after taxes/transfers) |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| United States | 17.8% |
| United Kingdom | 11.7% |
| Germany | 10.4% |
| Canada | 11.6% |
| France | 8.5% |
| Denmark | 5.5% |
| Finland | 5.7% |

The U.S. poverty rate is roughly double that of peer nations, primarily due to less generous safety net programs.

## Key Concepts

### Absolute vs. Relative Poverty

**Absolute Poverty**
- Fixed standard (poverty line)
- Ability to afford basic needs
- U.S. official measure

**Relative Poverty**
- Compared to median income (usually 50%)
- Measures economic distance from mainstream
- European standard; shows worse U.S. performance

### Poverty Gap

The aggregate amount needed to bring all poor households to the poverty line:
- 2022 poverty gap: approximately $175 billion
- Average gap per poor person: $4,600
- Smaller than many federal programs; suggests poverty is solvable

### Material Hardship

Poverty measures miss actual deprivation. Material hardship measures capture:

| Hardship | Prevalence |
|----------|------------|
| Food insecurity | 12.8% of households |
| Cannot afford medical care | 9.7% of adults |
| Behind on rent/mortgage | 7% of renters |
| Utilities shut off | 4% of households |

### Poverty Cliff

The sudden loss of benefits when income rises above eligibility thresholds, creating:
- Effective marginal tax rates over 100%
- Disincentives to work or earn more
- Trap that keeps families poor

## Framework for Analysis

### The Poverty Cycle

|  Limited         |     |  Lower Wages      |     |  Inadequate      |
|  Education       | --> |  Unstable Work    | --> |  Income          |

                        |  Stress, Debt   |
                        +<----------------+

```

### Causes Framework

| Category | Factors |
|----------|---------|
| **Economic** | Low wages, job instability, lack of benefits |
| **Educational** | Low skills, poor schools, limited credentials |
| **Family** | Single parenthood, caregiving responsibilities |
| **Health** | Disability, chronic illness, mental health |
| **Geographic** | Concentrated poverty, lack of opportunity |
| **Policy** | Weak safety net, work requirements, cliffs |
| **Discrimination** | Racial, gender, disability discrimination |

## Why This Matters

### For Children

- Poverty stunts brain development
- Reduces educational achievement
- Creates lifelong health problems
- Perpetuates cycle to next generation

### For Workers

- Full-time work should mean non-poverty
- Current minimum wage fails this test
- Benefits gap leaves workers vulnerable
- Wealth building impossible at poverty wages

### For Communities

- Concentrated poverty devastates neighborhoods
- Tax base eroded; services decline
- Crime and disorder increase
- Social capital destroyed

### For the Economy

- Lost human potential
- Higher healthcare and social costs
- Reduced consumer demand
- Economic growth suppressed

### For Democracy

- Political participation lower among poor
- Interests of poor underrepresented
- Inequality of voice threatens democracy
- Trust in institutions undermined
