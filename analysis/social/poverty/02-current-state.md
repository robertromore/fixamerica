# Poverty: Current State

## The Problem Today

### America's Poverty Crisis

Despite unprecedented national wealth, poverty persists at levels far exceeding those of peer nations. The United States has more poverty, deeper poverty, and less mobility out of poverty than virtually any other developed country. The 2021 expansion of the Child Tax Credit demonstrated that poverty can be dramatically reduced through policy, cutting child poverty nearly in half. Its expiration in 2022 led to an immediate spike, confirming that poverty is fundamentally a policy choice.

**Key Current Statistics (2022)**

|--------|-------|
| People in poverty | 37.9 million |
| Overall poverty rate | 11.5% |
| Child poverty rate | 16.3% |
