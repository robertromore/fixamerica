# Poverty: History

## Early American Attitudes

### Colonial Period to Early Republic

**English Poor Law Tradition**

America inherited English approaches to poverty:
- Distinction between "deserving" (disabled, elderly, widows) and "undeserving" poor
- Local responsibility (townships, parishes)
- Outdoor relief (aid in home) vs. indoor relief (poorhouses)
- Settlement laws restricting mobility
- Moral judgments about poverty

**Key Features**

| Era | Approach |
|-----|----------|
| Colonial | Local poor relief; church charity |
| Early Republic | State/local almshouses; private charity |
| 1820s-1850s | Reform movements; "moral" approaches |

- Food assistance reduced hunger
- Education spending improved opportunities
- Economic growth lifted many boats

### Nixon Era Developments

**Welfare Reform Debates**

| Proposal | Outcome |

## Conservative Backlash (1980-1996)

### Reagan Era Retrenchment

**Philosophy**

- State flexibility (block grants)
- Tax cuts over spending

**Cuts and Changes**

| Program | Change |
|---------|--------|
| AFDC | Eligibility tightened, benefits reduced |
| Food Stamps | Cuts and restrictions |
| Housing | Budget cut by 75% |
| Job training | Programs eliminated or cut |

| Year | Poverty Rate |
|------|--------------|
| 1980 | 13.0% |
| 1983 | 15.2% |
| 1989 | 12.8% |

### Growing Inequality

**While Poverty Fluctuated, Inequality Grew**

- Top incomes soared
- Wages stagnated for bottom half
- Benefits shifted to employment
- Union decline accelerated
- Safety net eroded

### "Welfare Reform" Debates (1988-1996)

**1988 Family Support Act**

- Work requirements (JOBS program)
- Transitional childcare and Medicaid
- Child support enforcement
- Still within AFDC structure

**Building Pressure for Reform**

| Factor | Pressure |
|--------|----------|
| Conservative criticism | "Dependency" narrative |
| State experimentation | Waivers for time limits, work requirements |
| Political positioning | Clinton's "end welfare as we know it" |
| Research debates | Underclass, culture of poverty |

## Welfare Reform and After (1996-Present)

### Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (1996)

**Ended the entitlement to assistance**

| AFDC (Before) | TANF (After) |
|---------------|--------------|
| Federal entitlement | Block grant to states |
| Open-ended funding | Fixed funding |
| No time limit | 5-year lifetime limit |
| Work encouraged | Work required |
| Federal standards | State flexibility |

**TANF Structure**

- $16.5 billion annual block grant (fixed since 1996)
- States control eligibility, benefits, spending
- Work requirements: 50% of caseload
- 5-year lifetime limit (60 months)
- States can be stricter

**Immediate Impact**

| Metric | 1996 | 2000 |
|--------|------|------|
| AFDC/TANF caseload | 4.4 million families | 2.2 million |
| Child poverty | 20.5% | 16.2% |
| Deep child poverty | 8.5% | 8.7% |
| Extreme poverty (<$2/day) | 0.9% | 1.2% |

### Post-Reform Era (2000-2020)

**Continuing Decline of Cash Assistance**

| Year | TANF Families | Share of Poor Families Served |
|------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| 1996 | 4.4 million | 68% |
| 2000 | 2.2 million | 52% |
| 2010 | 1.9 million | 27% |
| 2020 | 1.0 million | 21% |

**What Replaced Welfare**

| Shift | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| EITC expansion | Work-conditioned support |
| Child Tax Credit | Work-conditioned (partially) |
| SNAP growth | In-kind, less stigmatized |
| Medicaid expansion | ACA expansion for adults |
| SSI/SSDI | Disability rolls grew |

**Emerging Problems**

- Deep poverty increased
- Extreme poverty ($2/day or less) grew
- Disconnected mothers (no work, no welfare)
- Safety net holes for childless adults
- Geographic concentration worsened

### Great Recession (2008-2010)

**Poverty Surge**

| Year | Poverty Rate | People in Poverty |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| 2007 | 12.5% | 37.3 million |
| 2010 | 15.1% | 46.2 million |

**Policy Responses**

- Unemployment insurance extended
- SNAP expanded (ARRA)
- COBRA subsidies for health insurance
- TANF emergency fund (temporary)
- Recovery too slow for poverty reduction

### Recent Era (2010-Present)

**Slow Recovery**

- Poverty remained elevated post-recession
- Child poverty high throughout 2010s
- Wage growth weak until late 2010s
- Safety net work requirements increased

**2021 Transformation**

The American Rescue Plan:

| Change | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Expanded CTC ($3,000-3,600) | 9 million children lifted out of poverty |
| Made CTC fully refundable | Reached poorest children |
| Monthly payments | Regular income support |
| SPM child poverty | Cut nearly in half (to 5.2%) |

**2022 Expiration**

- CTC reverted to prior form
- Child poverty more than doubled
- Demonstrated both possibility and fragility

## The Poverty Line: A History

### Origins (1963-1965)

**Mollie Orshansky's Measure**

Social Security Administration economist Mollie Orshansky:
- Used minimum food budget (USDA Economy Food Plan)
- Multiplied by 3 (food was 1/3 of budget in 1955)
- Adjusted for family size
- Became official measure in 1969

**Original Thresholds (1963)**

| Family Size | Threshold |
|-------------|-----------|
| 1 person | $1,580 |
| 4 people | $3,130 |

### Problems Identified Early

| Problem | Identified |
|---------|------------|
| Food only 1/3 of budget | By 1970s, 1/7 of budget |
| No geographic adjustment | Noted from beginning |
| No work expenses | Recognized in 1970s |
| Misses many hardships | Documented throughout |

### Reform Efforts

| Effort | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| 1969 official adoption | Threshold set in regulation |
| 1970s reform proposals | Not implemented |
| 1995 NAS panel | Recommended comprehensive reform |
| 2011 SPM created | Supplemental measure, not replacement |
| Present | OPM still official measure |

## Lessons from History

### What Has Reduced Poverty

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Economic growth with shared gains | Pre-1980 prosperity |
| Social insurance | Social Security, Medicare |
| Direct income support | CTC expansion 2021 |
| In-kind benefits | SNAP, Medicaid |
| Labor market reforms | Minimum wage, unions |

### What Has Increased Poverty

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Economic recessions | 1980s, 2008, 2020 |
| Safety net retrenchment | 1980s cuts, 1996 welfare reform |
| Wage stagnation | Post-1980 divergence |
| Union decline | Bargaining power lost |
| Benefit expiration | 2022 CTC reversion |

### Persistent Patterns

1. **Racial disparities**: Present throughout, despite changes
2. **Work requirements**: Consistent policy preference
3. **Deserving/undeserving distinction**: Never fully abandoned
4. **State variation**: Local control creates unequal treatment
5. **Political fragility**: Gains reversed by political change
