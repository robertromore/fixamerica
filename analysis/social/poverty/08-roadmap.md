# Poverty: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Overview

Reducing poverty requires a multi-pronged, sustained effort over years. This roadmap sequences reforms based on political feasibility, administrative capacity, and maximum impact. The strategy prioritizes changes that build momentum, create constituencies for further reform, and address root causes while providing immediate relief.

## Guiding Principles

### Sequencing Logic

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Quick wins first** | Build momentum, demonstrate success |
| **Build coalitions** | Universal programs create broader support |

|---------|----------|
| **Framing** | Work and family, not "welfare" |
