# Poverty: Overview

Nearly 38 million Americans live in poverty, including one in six children. Despite being the world's wealthiest nation, the United States has among the highest poverty rates of developed countries. Poverty in America is not merely a lack of income; it is a systemic condition that limits opportunity, shortens lives, undermines child development, and perpetuates disadvantage across generations.
