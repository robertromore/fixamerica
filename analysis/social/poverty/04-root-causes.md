# Poverty: Root Causes

## Why Poverty Persists

Poverty in America is not a failure of the economy to produce enough wealth--the United States is the wealthiest nation in history. Poverty persists because of how that wealth is distributed, how markets function, how policy shapes outcomes, and how historical injustices compound over generations. Understanding root causes is essential to designing effective solutions.

## Economic Causes

### Low Wages

**The Minimum Wage Problem**

| Year | Federal Minimum | 2024 Value | Full-Time Annual |
|------|-----------------|------------|------------------|
| 1968 | $1.60 | $14.00+ | $29,120 |
| 2009 | $7.25 | $10.14 | $21,090 |
| 2024 | $7.25 | $7.25 | $15,080 |

**Why Low Wages Cause Poverty**

- Full-time minimum wage work yields $15,080/year
- Poverty line for family of 2: $20,440
- Even full-time work leaves families poor
- Many workers earn above minimum but below living wage

**Wage Structure**

| Percentile | Hourly Wage | Annual (FT) |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 10th | $11.40 | $23,700 |
| 20th | $14.00 | $29,120 |
| 30th | $16.80 | $34,940 |
| Median | $22.00 | $45,760 |

### Job Quality Decline

**Erosion of Good Jobs**

| Factor | Trend |
|--------|-------|
| Full-time jobs | More part-time, contingent |
| Benefits | Fewer jobs with health, retirement |
| Stability | More temporary, on-call |
| Scheduling | Unpredictable hours |
| Career ladders | Fewer internal promotions |

**The Shift**

- Manufacturing decline (well-paying, unionized)
- Service sector growth (low-paying, non-union)
- Gig economy expansion (no benefits, unstable)
- Automation displacing middle-skill jobs
- Subcontracting and temp agencies

### Unemployment and Underemployment

**Multiple Dimensions**

| Measure | Rate |
|---------|------|
| Official unemployment | 3.7% (2024) |
| Including discouraged workers | 4.5% |
| Including part-time for economic reasons | 7.0% |
| Unemployment in poor communities | 15%+ |

**Who Bears the Burden**

- Black unemployment: 2x white rate
- Young workers: higher rates
- Less educated: higher rates
- Economic downturns hit poor hardest

### Work-Family Conflicts

**Childcare Crisis**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Average cost | $10,000-15,000/year (one child) |
| Share of income (poor families) | 30%+ |
| Availability | Deserts in many areas |
| Quality | Variable, often poor |

**Time Poverty**

- Two-earner families necessary
- Longer work hours than peer nations
- Unpredictable schedules
- No paid leave (federal)
- Caregiving responsibilities

## Labor Market Structure

### Decline of Worker Power

**Union Decline**

| Year | Union Membership |
|------|------------------|
| 1955 | 35% |
| 1980 | 23% |
| 2000 | 13% |
| 2023 | 10% |

**Impact of Decline**

- Wages 10-20% lower without union
- Benefits less available
- Voice in workplace lost
- Political power diminished
- "Threat effect" gone (non-union employers matched union)

**Why Unions Declined**

- Hostile legal environment
- Employer resistance
- Globalization and plant closures
- Service sector hard to organize
- Weak enforcement of labor law

### Monopsony and Employer Power

**Concentrated Labor Markets**

- Many workers have few employer options
- Non-compete agreements restrict mobility
- Geographic isolation limits choices
- Wages suppressed by lack of competition

**Wage Suppression Mechanisms**

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Non-competes | Workers can't switch |
| No-poach agreements | Employers don't compete |
| Wage-fixing | Illegal but common |
| Scheduling control | On-call reduces options |

### Discrimination

**Wage Penalties**

| Group | Wage Gap (vs. white men) |
|-------|--------------------------|
| White women | 79 cents |
| Black men | 76 cents |
| Black women | 63 cents |
| Hispanic women | 57 cents |

**Discrimination in Hiring**

- Resume studies show discrimination persists
- Criminal record penalty (higher for Black applicants)
- Address discrimination (poor neighborhoods)
- Age, disability, appearance discrimination

## Policy Causes

### Inadequate Safety Net

**Holes in the Net**

| Gap | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| TANF decline | Only 21% of poor families reached |
| SSI insufficiency | $914/month maximum |
| Unemployment coverage | Only 1 in 4 unemployed receive benefits |
| Childless adults | Few programs available |
| Undocumented immigrants | Excluded from most programs |

**Benefit Levels**

| Program | Benefit Level | Poverty Impact |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| TANF (median state) | $492/month | 29% of poverty line |
| SSI | $914/month | 75% of poverty line |
| SNAP (max, family 4) | $939/month | Reduces food insecurity |
| EITC (max, 3 children) | $7,430/year | Reduces poverty but not eliminate |

### Work Requirements and Barriers

**Work Requirements**

| Program | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| TANF | Work activity after 24 months; 30 hours/week |
| SNAP | Work requirement for able-bodied adults 18-49 |
| Medicaid | Some states require work |
| Housing | Some programs have requirements |

**Why Work Requirements Increase Poverty**

- Jobs not always available
- Health problems interfere
- Caregiving conflicts
- Transportation barriers
- Administrative hassle causes loss

### The Benefits Cliff

**How the Cliff Works**

When income rises above eligibility thresholds, benefits end abruptly:

| Income Level | Benefits Lost |
|--------------|---------------|
| $15,000 | May lose TANF |
| $25,000 | May lose Medicaid |
| $30,000 | May lose housing assistance |
| $35,000 | May lose SNAP, EITC phases out |
| $45,000 | May lose childcare assistance |

**Effective Marginal Tax Rates**

- Can exceed 100% at cliff points
- Taking a raise can mean losing more in benefits
- Creates disincentive to advance
- Traps families just below thresholds

### Tax Policy

**Regressive Elements**

| Factor | Effect on Poor |
|--------|----------------|
| Payroll tax | 7.65% from first dollar; regressive |
| Sales taxes | Higher burden as share of income |
| Property taxes | Passed through to renters |
| Sin taxes | Regressive |

**Limited Progressivity**

- EITC helps, but requires work
- CTC not fully refundable (pre-2021)
- Deductions favor high earners
- Capital gains preference for wealthy

## Social and Demographic Causes

### Family Structure

**Single Parenthood and Poverty**

| Family Type | Poverty Rate |
|-------------|--------------|
| Married couple | 5.0% |
| Single mother | 26.3% |
| Single father | 12.5% |

**Why Single Parenthood Increases Poverty**

- One earner instead of two
- Childcare needs more acute
- Less flexibility for work
- Time poverty
- Historical discrimination against single mothers

**But Family Structure Isn't the Whole Story**

- Single-parent poverty lower in peer nations
- Policy can compensate (universal childcare)
- Some poverty causes family dissolution
- Causation runs both directions

### Education and Skills

**Education-Poverty Connection**

| Education Level | Poverty Rate |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Less than high school | 24.3% |
| High school diploma | 12.3% |
| Some college | 9.4% |
| Bachelor's degree+ | 4.2% |

**Why Education Gaps Persist**

- Unequal K-12 funding (property tax base)
- School segregation (income and race)
- College costs and debt
- Return to education requires access
- Credentials often required unnecessarily

### Health and Disability

**Health-Poverty Cycle**

+------------------+     +-------------------+     +------------------+
|  Poverty         |     |  Poor Health      |     |  Reduced Work    |
|                  | --> |  Access/Outcomes  | --> |  Capacity        |
+------------------+     +-------------------+     +------------------+

       |                                                    |
       +----------------------------------------------------+

```

**Disability and Poverty**

- 24% poverty rate (working-age with disability)
- Employment discrimination
- Inadequate SSI/SSDI
- Work disincentives in disability programs
- Healthcare tied to benefit receipt

### Incarceration

**Mass Incarceration's Poverty Impact**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| During incarceration | No income, family impoverished |
| Employment post-release | Criminal record penalty |
| Housing access | Barriers to subsidized and private |
| Benefits access | Many excluded by record |
| Debt | Fines, fees, child support |

**The Numbers**

- 2 million incarcerated
- 77 million with criminal records
- 1 in 3 Black men have felony convictions
- Wage penalty: 10-40% after incarceration
- Unemployment much higher for formerly incarcerated

## Historical and Structural Causes

### Intergenerational Transmission

**How Poverty Perpetuates**

| Mechanism | Transmission Path |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Wealth | No inheritance, no head start |
| Education | Lower-quality schools, less college |
| Networks | Limited connections to opportunities |
| Place | Concentrated poverty neighborhoods |
| Health | Poor outcomes compound |
| Trauma | ACEs affect development |

**Mobility Statistics**

- 33% of children in bottom quintile remain there as adults
- 7.5% chance of moving from bottom to top quintile
- Correlation between parent and child income: 0.5
- Less mobile than most peer nations

### Racial Wealth Gap

**Compounding Historical Injustices**

| Era | Discrimination |
|-----|----------------|
| Slavery | Unpaid labor, no wealth accumulation |
| Jim Crow | Segregation, economic exclusion |
| New Deal | Excluded from key programs |
| GI Bill | Unequal access to benefits |
| Redlining | Excluded from homeownership |
| Mass incarceration | Targeted enforcement |
| Present | Discrimination in labor, housing, credit |

**Current Wealth Gap**

| Group | Median Wealth |
|-------|---------------|
| White families | $188,200 |
| Black families | $24,100 |
| Hispanic families | $36,100 |

### Geographic Concentration

**Persistent Poverty Areas**

| Region | History |
|--------|---------|
| Deep South | Slavery, sharecropping, Jim Crow |
| Appalachia | Extraction economy, corporate control |
| Border regions | Colonization, discrimination |
| Reservations | Forced relocation, treaty violations |
| Inner cities | Redlining, white flight, disinvestment |

**Why Place Matters**

- Fewer jobs
- Lower-quality schools
- Less healthcare access
- Limited transportation
- Environmental hazards
- Network poverty

## Ideological and Political Causes

### Poverty Discourse

**Dominant Narratives**

| Narrative | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Individual responsibility | Blames poor for poverty |
| Dependency | Opposes income support |
| Deserving/undeserving | Divides poor against each other |
| Work ethic | Requires work for any support |
| Bootstraps | Ignores structural barriers |

**How Narratives Shape Policy**

- Work requirements on assistance
- Time limits on benefits
- Drug testing for recipients
- Stigma reduces take-up
- Punitive approaches favored

### Political Economy

**Why Policy Doesn't Reduce Poverty More**

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Wealthy influence | Campaign contributions, lobbying |
| Business opposition | Labor costs, taxes |
| Racial politics | Divide and conquer |
| Geographic sorting | Poor underrepresented |
| Low turnout | Poor less likely to vote |

**Policy Reflects Power**

- Tax cuts benefit wealthy
- Safety net retrenchment continues
- Minimum wage stagnates
- Union protections weakened
- Employer power protected

### Multiple Causes in Action

**Example: Single Mother in Poverty**

| Cause | Contribution |
|-------|--------------|
| Gender wage gap | Earns less for same work |
| Occupational segregation | In low-wage female-dominated job |
| Childcare costs | Consumes much of income |
| Father absent | Only one earner |
| Weak TANF | Little cash support |
| Benefits cliff | Faces marginal rate over 100% |
| Discrimination | Employer bias against mothers |
| Education | Limited credentials due to background |
| Place | Lives in low-opportunity area |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Low wages are fundamental**: Work doesn't guarantee escape from poverty
2. **Job quality has declined**: Benefits, stability, hours have worsened
3. **Policy choices matter**: Safety net could do more but doesn't
4. **Work requirements backfire**: Create barriers, not pathways
5. **Discrimination persists**: Race and gender still determine outcomes
6. **History matters**: Past injustice compounds into present disadvantage
7. **Place concentrates poverty**: Geography limits opportunity
8. **Family structure is factor, not destiny**: Policy can compensate
9. **Intergenerational transmission is key**: Children inherit disadvantage
10. **Causes interconnect**: No single solution will suffice
