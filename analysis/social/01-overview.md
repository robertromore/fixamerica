# Social: Overview

## Executive Summary

America's social safety net is fragmented, inadequate, and increasingly failing to prevent poverty. Despite spending over $700 billion annually on means-tested programs, 38 million Americans live in poverty—including 11 million children. The 1996 welfare reform gutted cash assistance, leaving TANF reaching only 21% of poor families compared to 68% before reform. SNAP benefits last only 21 days per month on average. SSI asset limits haven't changed since 1989. Unemployment insurance reaches only 28% of the jobless. Meanwhile, the 2021 Child Tax Credit expansion demonstrated that well-designed policy can cut child poverty nearly in half—but it was allowed to expire. This domain analyzes the safety net's failures and proposes comprehensive reforms.

## Scope

This domain covers the social safety net and anti-poverty policy:

- **Income support**: Cash assistance, tax credits, income maintenance
- **Nutrition**: SNAP, WIC, school meals, food banks
- **Disability assistance**: SSI, disability determination
- **Child and family policy**: Child poverty, child welfare, family support
- **Unemployment**: Unemployment insurance system
- **System design**: Coordination, benefit cliffs, administrative burden
- **Anti-poverty strategies**: UBI, baby bonds, comprehensive approaches

## Key Facts

- **Poverty rate**: 11.5% overall (38 million), 16.3% children (11 million), 10.3% elderly
- **TANF collapse**: Only 21 families receive TANF for every 100 in poverty (vs. 68 in 1996)
- **SNAP reach**: 42 million participants; benefits average $234/month, last 21 days
- **SSI inadequacy**: $943/month maximum (below poverty line); $2,000 asset limit unchanged since 1989
- **Unemployment**: Only 28% of jobless receive UI (lowest on record)
- **Child poverty**: Could be cut in half with 2021-style CTC; spiked to 12.4% when expansion expired
- **Cost of poverty**: $1 trillion+ annually in lost productivity, healthcare, crime

## Key Questions

- Why did the 1996 welfare reform hollow out cash assistance?
- What would it take to ensure no child grows up in poverty?
- How can the safety net be redesigned to eliminate benefit cliffs?
- Why does the U.S. have higher child poverty than peer countries?
- What role should universal programs vs. means-tested programs play?
- How can evidence-based programs be scaled effectively?
- What would a comprehensive anti-poverty strategy look like?

## Core Tensions

### Universal vs. Targeted

Universal programs (Social Security, Medicare) are popular and effective but costly. Targeted means-tested programs reach fewer people, create administrative burden, and stigmatize recipients. The tension shapes debates over child allowances, UBI, and program design.

### Work Requirements vs. Unconditional Support

Most U.S. programs require work or work-seeking behavior. Proponents argue this encourages self-sufficiency; critics note it excludes the most vulnerable, creates administrative burden, and ignores care work. TANF work requirements contributed to caseload collapse.

### Federal Standards vs. State Flexibility

Federal programs can ensure national minimums but may not fit local conditions. Block grants give state flexibility but enable race to bottom (TANF benefits vary 10x across states). The tension shapes debates over program structure.

### Cash vs. In-Kind

SNAP provides food-specific benefits; some prefer direct cash. In-kind programs may be more politically palatable but restrict recipient choice. Evidence generally supports cash as effective and efficient.

## What Success Looks Like

- **Zero child poverty**: No child growing up poor (achievable with expanded CTC)
- **Adequate cash assistance**: TANF benefits at 50%+ of poverty, reaching majority of poor families
- **Food security**: No household food insecure; SNAP benefits adequate for full month
- **SSI modernization**: Asset limits updated, benefits at poverty line, processing timely
- **Unemployment protection**: 50%+ of jobless covered, gig workers included
- **No benefit cliffs**: Gradual phase-outs, marginal tax rates below 70%
- **Poverty halved**: Overall poverty rate below 6% (current European levels)

## Relationship to Other Domains

Social safety net intersects with multiple policy areas:

### Economic Domain

- **Inequality** ([economic/inequality/](../economic/inequality/01-overview.md)): Safety net reduces but doesn't eliminate market inequality
- **Wages** ([economic/wages/](../economic/wages/01-overview.md)): Low wages drive need for supplements (EITC, SNAP)
- **Consumer Debt** ([economic/consumer-debt/](../economic/consumer-debt/01-overview.md)): Inadequate safety net drives borrowing

### Labor Domain

- **Minimum Wage** ([labor/minimum-wage/](../labor/minimum-wage/01-overview.md)): Wage floor affects safety net need
- **Gig Economy** ([labor/gig-economy/](../labor/gig-economy/01-overview.md)): Gig workers excluded from UI and many protections
- **Paid Leave** ([labor/paid-leave/](../labor/paid-leave/01-overview.md)): Absence of paid leave drives poverty during illness, caregiving

### Healthcare Domain

- **Medicaid** ([healthcare/medicaid/](../healthcare/medicaid/01-overview.md)): Medicaid is part of safety net; eligibility aligned with other programs
- **Healthcare Access** ([healthcare/healthcare-access/](../healthcare/healthcare-access/01-overview.md)): Poverty affects health; health affects poverty

### Housing Domain

- **Homelessness** ([housing/homelessness/](../housing/homelessness/01-overview.md)): Safety net failure contributes to homelessness
- **Public Housing** ([housing/public-housing/](../housing/public-housing/01-overview.md)): Housing assistance part of broader safety net

### Education Domain

- **Early Childhood** ([education/early-childhood/](../education/early-childhood/01-overview.md)): Head Start, early intervention, child development
- **Student Debt** ([education/student-debt/](../education/student-debt/01-overview.md)): Safety net interactions with education financing
