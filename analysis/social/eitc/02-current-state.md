## The Childless Worker Gap

### Current Treatment

**Stark Disparity**

| Metric | Childless | Family (3+ children) | Ratio |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| Maximum credit | $632 | $7,830 | 1:12 |
| Income limit (single) | $18,591 | $59,899 | 1:3 |
| Phase-in rate | 7.65% | 45% | 1:6 |
| Average credit | $290 | $5,800 | 1:20 |

**Age Restrictions (Current)**

| Status | Age Requirement |
|--------|-----------------|
| With qualifying children | None |
| Childless workers | 25-64 |
| Former foster youth/homeless | 18+ (through 2025) |
| Full-time students (childless) | Generally ineligible |

### Who Is Excluded

**Childless Workers Affected**

| Category | Estimated Number |
|----------|------------------|
| Workers 19-24 | 6 million low-wage |
| Workers 65+ | 3 million |
| Workers receiving token credit | 17 million |
| Would-be EITC eligible if had children | 25+ million |

**Why the Gap Exists**

Historical reasons:
- Original EITC (1975) was family-focused
- Childless credit added in 1994, intentionally minimal
- Policymakers prioritized children
- Work incentive rationale focused on parents
- Concerns about cost of expansion

### 2021 Temporary Expansion

The American Rescue Plan temporarily expanded the childless worker EITC:

| Parameter | Pre-2021 | 2021 (Temporary) | 2024 (Reverted) |
|-----------|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Maximum credit | $543 | $1,502 | $632 |
| Age range | 25-64 | 19-64 (some 18+) | 25-64 |
| Income limit | $15,820 | $21,430 | $18,591 |

**Results of 2021 Expansion**

- 17 million childless workers received larger credit
- 2.8 million additional workers became eligible
- Average credit tripled
- Demonstrated feasibility and impact
