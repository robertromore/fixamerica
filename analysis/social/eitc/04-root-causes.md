# Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC): Root Causes

## Why the EITC Has Gaps

The EITC successfully lifts millions out of poverty, yet leaves significant gaps--particularly for childless workers, young workers, and those who don't claim. These gaps stem from intentional design choices, political constraints, administrative challenges, and interactions with broader systems. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing effective reforms.

## Design Choices That Create Gaps

### The Childless Worker Gap

**Why Childless Workers Receive So Little**

| Cause | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| Original family focus | 1975 EITC designed for workers with children |
| "Deserving" distinction | Children seen as innocent, deserving support |
| Work incentive framing | Parents need more incentive to work (presumed) |
| Political economy | Families with children more sympathetic |
| Cost concerns | Expanding to childless expensive |
| Payroll tax rationale | 7.65% credit meant to offset payroll taxes |

**The 1994 Compromise**

When childless workers were first included in 1993 legislation:
- Credit set at minimal level (offset payroll tax only)
- Phase-in rate of 7.65% (matches employee payroll tax)
- Maximum credit fraction of family credit
- Age restrictions added (25-64)
- Clear second-tier status

**Rationale and Its Problems**

| Original Rationale | Problem with Rationale |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Parents need work incentive | Childless also need incentive |
| Children need support | Adults without children also in poverty |
| Offset payroll tax | Poverty exists beyond payroll tax offset |
| Resources limited | Poverty gap could be filled |
| Age restrictions reduce fraud | Arbitrary exclusion |

### Age Restrictions

**Current Age Limits for Childless**

| Restriction | Rationale | Problem |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Minimum age 25 | Students shouldn't claim | Excludes working young adults |
| Maximum age 64 | Elderly have Social Security | Excludes working seniors |
| No age limit for parents | Children present | Arbitrary distinction |

**Who Is Excluded**

| Group | Situation |
|-------|-----------|
| Workers 18-24 | Low-wage, need support, building careers |
| Workers 65+ | Working out of necessity, still low-income |
| Transition-age foster youth | Especially vulnerable |
| Young parents later without custody | Age restriction returns |

### Phase-In/Phase-Out Structure

**Work Incentive vs. Marginal Tax Rate**

| Range | Effect on Work | Effect on Poverty |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Phase-in | Strong positive | Credit increases |
| Plateau | Neutral | Maximum credit |
| Phase-out | Negative | Credit decreases |

**The Phase-Out Problem**

Phase-out creates implicit marginal tax rate:
- 15.98% for 1 child
- 21.06% for 2+ children
- Stacks with payroll tax (7.65%)
- Stacks with income tax (10%+)
- Combined rates can exceed 40-50%

**Alternative Design Not Chosen**

| Alternative | Why Not Chosen |
|-------------|----------------|
| No phase-out (universal) | Too expensive |
| Slower phase-out | Higher cost |
| Cliff (end abruptly) | Work disincentive worse |
| Tie to hours worked | Administrative complexity |

## Political Causes

### Work-Based Framing

**Why EITC Requires Work**

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Bipartisan support | Work requirement maintains coalition |
| Distinguish from welfare | "Earned" versus "unearned" |
| Political messaging | "Helping workers" resonates |
| Conservative support | Not "handout" |
| Democratic support | Rewards work |

**Consequences of Work Requirement**

| Consequence | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Excludes non-workers | Poorest may not qualify |
| Self-employment complexity | Hard to verify |
| Irregular work | May not reach maximum |
| Caregivers | Unpaid work doesn't count |

### Cost Constraints

**Why Expansions Are Limited**

| Constraint | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| Deficit concerns | Scoring against baseline |
| Pay-for requirements | Must offset cost |
| Competing priorities | Limited budget space |
| 10-year budget windows | Front-loaded costs visible |
| Political cost | Opposition to "spending" |

**Cost of Proposed Expansions**

| Expansion | 10-Year Cost |
|-----------|--------------|
| Make 2021 childless permanent | $135 billion |
| Expand to age 18 | $20 billion |
| Increase for all families | $50-100 billion |
| Universal child allowance | $200+ billion |

### Political Coalitions

**Who Supports EITC (and Why)**

| Group | Motivation |
|-------|------------|
| Anti-poverty advocates | Reduces poverty |
| Business groups (some) | Alternative to minimum wage |
| Conservatives (some) | Work-based, not welfare |
| Economists | Efficient, maintains incentives |
| Tax reformers | Simplifies for low-income |

**Who Opposes Expansion (and Why)**

| Group | Objection |
|-------|-----------|
| Fiscal hawks | Cost |
| Some conservatives | "Government handouts" |
| Some progressives | Doesn't help non-workers |
| Minimum wage advocates | Subsidizes low-wage employers |
| Some economists | Phase-out work disincentive |

## Administrative Causes

### Why Participation Is Incomplete

**Information Barriers**

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Complex eligibility rules | People don't know they qualify |
| Limited outreach | IRS doesn't proactively identify |
| Language barriers | Materials not accessible |
| Stigma | "Tax credit" still carries stigma |
| Filing requirements | Must file to claim |

**Filing Barriers**

| Barrier | Population Affected |
|---------|---------------------|
| Very low income | May not need to file otherwise |
| Informal economy | Fear of reporting income |
| Homeless | No address, documentation |
| Immigrants | Fear of system |
| Previously audited | Deterred from claiming |

**Claiming Barriers**

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Complex forms | Errors lead to denial |
| Documentation required | Hard to prove residency |
| Preparer costs | $200-300 to prepare |
| Self-preparation | Higher error rates |
| Audit risk | Deters claims |

### Why Improper Payments Persist

**Qualifying Child Rules Complexity**

| Test | Complexity |
|------|------------|
| Age | Relatively simple |
| Relationship | Extended family, foster situations |
| Residency | "More than half the year" hard to document |
| Support | Calculations complex |
| Joint return | Exceptions unclear |
| Tiebreaker | Multiple claimants, custody |

**Documentation Challenges**

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Informal living arrangements | No lease, no utility bills |
| Shared custody | Each parent may claim |
| Moving frequently | Multiple addresses |
| Extended family | Grandparents, aunts claiming |
| Self-employment | Income hard to verify |

**System Design**

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Pay first, verify later | Creates overpayments |
| Limited data matching | Can't verify residency |
| Volunteer reliance | VITA limited capacity |
| Preparer incentives | More credit = more fees |
| Annual claim | Year-end snapshot may not reflect reality |

### IRS Capacity Limitations

**Resource Constraints**

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Underfunded IRS | Limited enforcement |
| Complex code | EITC rules difficult to administer |
| Paper returns | Manual processing |
| Customer service | Hard to reach |
| Audit resources | Can't verify all claims |

**Technology Gaps**

| Gap | Consequence |
|-----|-------------|
| No real-time verification | Post-payment audits |
| Limited data sharing | Can't cross-check |
| Paper documentation | Slow, error-prone |
| Legacy systems | Modernization delayed |

## Economic Causes

### Low Wages Create Need for EITC

**The Wage Problem**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Stagnant minimum wage | $7.25 since 2009 |
| Low-wage job growth | More workers need EITC |
| Benefit erosion | Fewer employer benefits |
| Part-time involuntary | Lower earnings |
| Gig economy | Irregular, low income |

**EITC as Wage Subsidy**

| Perspective | Argument |
|-------------|----------|
| Critics | Subsidizes low-wage employers |
| Defenders | Workers get benefit directly |
| Research | Some pass-through to employers |
| Net effect | Both workers and employers benefit |

### Employer Benefit

**How Employers Gain**

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Wage suppression | Can pay less knowing EITC supplements |
| Taxpayer subsidy | Public pays for private workforce support |
| Labor supply increase | More workers available at lower wage |
| Reduced pressure | Less demand for minimum wage |

**Research Evidence**

- Some studies find EITC reduces pre-tax wages
- Effect estimated at 5-15% of credit
- Incidence shared between worker and employer
- Net benefit still primarily to workers

## Structural Causes

### Tax System Limitations

**Annual Versus Monthly Income**

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Annual accounting | Ignores monthly variation |
| Income volatility | May qualify some months, not year |
| Lump sum payment | Doesn't address monthly bills |
| Advance payment failed | 1990s attempt didn't work |

**Filing-Based System**

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Must file to claim | Many low-income don't file |
| Complex returns | Errors common |
| Preparer reliance | Costs money |
| Annual reconciliation | Overpayments hard to recoup |

### Federalism and State Variation

**Why State EITCs Vary**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| State fiscal capacity | Poorer states less able |
| Political ideology | Red states less likely |
| Income tax structure | No income tax = no credit |
| Policy diffusion | Spreads slowly |

**Geographic Inequality**

| Region | State EITC Status |
|--------|-------------------|
| Northeast | Most have credits |
| West Coast | Strong credits |
| South | Fewer credits |
| Midwest | Mixed |

## Interaction Effects

### Benefits Cliff Dynamics

**How EITC Contributes**

| Issue | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Phase-out adds to marginal rate | Combined with other programs |
| Cliff stacking | EITC, SNAP, Medicaid, housing |
| Effective rates over 50% | Disincentive to earn more |
| Threshold effects | Small income changes cause large benefit swings |

**The Combined Problem**

| Income Range | Combined Marginal Rate |
|--------------|------------------------|
| EITC phase-in | Negative (subsidy) |
| EITC phase-out only | 15-21% |
| + Payroll tax | 23-29% |
| + SNAP phase-out | 47-53% |
| + Medicaid cliff | Can exceed 80% |

### Marriage Penalty Dynamics

**Why Penalties Exist**

| Cause | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Single-earner focus | Credit designed for one earner |
| Combined income | Two earners hit phase-out faster |
| Higher thresholds insufficient | Married thresholds don't fully compensate |
| Work incentive conflict | Both work = penalty |

**Typical Scenarios**

| Scenario | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Two minimum wage earners marry | Penalty $1,000-2,500 |
| Low earner marries non-earner | Bonus $500-1,500 |
| Both moderate earners | Penalty possible |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Childless gap intentional**: Minimal credit was deliberate design choice
2. **Work requirement central**: Political support depends on it
3. **Cost constraints real**: Expansions require revenue
4. **Administration complex**: Qualifying child rules drive errors
5. **Low wages create need**: EITC compensates for market failures
6. **Participation gaps persistent**: 20% don't claim
7. **State variation inequitable**: Where you live matters
8. **Interactions create cliffs**: EITC alone is efficient; combined less so
9. **Marriage penalties designed in**: Two-earner couples penalized
10. **Age restrictions arbitrary**: Young and old workers excluded
