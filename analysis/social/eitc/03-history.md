# Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC): History

## Origins (1975)

### The Birth of the EITC

**Context: 1970s Economic Turmoil**

The EITC emerged from a specific economic and political moment:
- Stagflation (high inflation, high unemployment)
- Rising payroll taxes burdening low-wage workers
- Welfare reform debates (Nixon's Family Assistance Plan failed)
- Search for work-based alternatives to cash welfare
- Bipartisan interest in tax-based solutions

**Senator Russell Long's Vision**

Louisiana Senator Russell Long, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, championed the credit:
- Long opposed guaranteed income proposals
- Favored "work bonus" over welfare
- Saw credit as offset to payroll taxes
- Wanted to reward work, not provide unconditional support

**Tax Reduction Act of 1975**

| Feature | Original EITC |
|---------|---------------|
| Maximum credit | $400 |
| Credit rate | 10% of first $4,000 earnings |
| Phase-out start | $4,000 |
| Income limit | $8,000 |
| Target population | Workers with children |
| Refundable | Yes |
| Temporary | Initially yes, made permanent 1978 |

**Original Purpose**

The 1975 EITC was designed to:
- Offset payroll taxes for low-income families
- Provide work incentive (alternative to welfare)
- Support families with children
- Be simple and administered through tax code

## Early Development (1978-1986)

### Made Permanent (1978)

The Revenue Act of 1978:
- Made EITC permanent
- Indexed maximum credit for inflation
- Maintained basic structure
- Established EITC as ongoing policy

### Reagan Era Paradox

**Initial Skepticism**

- Reagan administration initially proposed eliminating EITC
- Seen as potentially duplicative with welfare
- Some conservatives viewed as social engineering

**1986 Tax Reform: Major Expansion**

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 dramatically expanded the EITC:

| Change | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Maximum credit | $550 | $851 |
| Credit rate | 11% | 14% |
| Income limit | $11,000 | $17,000 |
| Indexing | Yes | Yes |

**Why Reagan Signed On**

- Seen as alternative to minimum wage increase
- Work-based (not "welfare")
- Offset tax burden on poor
- Part of comprehensive tax reform

## Clinton Era Expansion (1990-1996)

### 1990 Expansion

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90):

| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Separate schedules | Different rates for 1 child vs. 2+ children |
| Increased maximum | Significant increase |
| Health insurance credit | Added supplemental credit |
| Young child credit | Additional amount for children under 1 |

### 1993: The Big Expansion

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 93) was the largest EITC expansion in history:

| Feature | Before | After (Phased in by 1996) |
|---------|--------|---------------------------|
| Max credit (1 child) | $1,511 | $2,094 |
| Max credit (2+ children) | $1,511 | $3,370 |
| Childless workers | Not eligible | $306 maximum |
| Income limit (2+ children) | $22,370 | $27,000 |

**Key Innovations**

| Innovation | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| Three-tier structure | 0, 1, 2+ children |
| Childless worker credit | First time, though minimal |
| Substantial increases | Doubled credit for families |
| Anti-poverty goal explicit | Designed to lift families above poverty line |

**Clinton's Goals**

President Clinton explicitly tied EITC expansion to welfare reform:
- "Make work pay"
- Alternative to welfare dependency
- Combined with minimum wage increase
- Part of "New Democrat" approach

### 1996 Welfare Reform Connection

The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (1996):
- Ended AFDC entitlement
- Required work for welfare recipients
- EITC became primary support for working poor
- Complementary policy: work requirements + work support

**EITC as Welfare Replacement**

| Program | Direction |
|---------|-----------|
| AFDC/TANF | Contracted dramatically |
| EITC | Expanded substantially |
| Net effect | Shift from unconditional to work-conditioned support |

## 1997-2008: Refinements and Compliance Focus

### 1997 Changes

The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997:

| Change | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Child Tax Credit created | Complementary benefit |
| EITC interaction rules | Coordination with CTC |
| Compliance provisions | Address improper payments |

### Compliance Crackdown

**Late 1990s-2000s Focus on Improper Payments**

| Initiative | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| IRS audits increased | EITC claims scrutinized |
| Paid preparer rules | Due diligence requirements |
| Math error authority | IRS could deny claims |
| Pre-certification tested | Require proof before payment (controversial) |

**Controversy Over Enforcement**

| Perspective | Position |
|-------------|----------|
| IRS/Treasury | Improper payments too high (20-25%) |
| Advocates | Over-enforcement deters eligible |
| Research | Most errors documentation, not fraud |
| Result | Tension between access and accuracy |

### 2001 EGTRRA Changes

The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001:
- Simplified marriage penalty relief
- Increased phase-out threshold for married couples
- Beginning of married filer adjustments

### 2008 Financial Crisis Response

Emergency legislation included:
- Some EITC adjustments
- Enhanced refundability of CTC
- Stimulus payments interacted with tax credits
- Temporary improvements

## 2009-2020: Obama-Era Expansion and Stability

### American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009)

| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Third child category | New tier for 3+ children (45% rate) |
| Marriage penalty reduction | Higher phase-out for married |
| Made "permanent" | Extended through 2017, later permanent |

**Three-Plus Children Category**

| Parameter | 2 Children | 3+ Children |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Phase-in rate | 40% | 45% |
| Maximum credit | $5,036 | $5,666 (2009) |
| Rationale | Larger families need more |

### 2015 PATH Act

The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015:
- Made 2009 expansions permanent
- Three-child tier permanent
- Marriage penalty relief permanent
- Established long-term stability

### Compliance Changes

| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Refund delay | Refunds with EITC/ACTC held until mid-February |
| Identity verification | PIN programs |
| Preparer requirements | Strengthened due diligence |

## 2021: The American Rescue Plan Expansion

### Temporary Childless Worker Expansion

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 made the largest childless worker EITC expansion ever:

| Parameter | Pre-2021 | 2021 Expansion |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Maximum credit | $543 | $1,502 |
| Age minimum | 25 | 19 (some 18) |
| Age maximum | 64 | None |
| Income limit (single) | $15,820 | $21,430 |
| Phase-in rate | 7.65% | 15.3% |

| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Investment income limit | Raised to $10,000 (indexed) |
| Foster youth/homeless | Eligible at 18 |
| Separated spouse provision | New flexibility |

### Why Only Temporary

**Political Context**

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Reconciliation rules | Revenue implications |
| Manchin/Sinema opposition | Concerns about cost, work incentives |
| Build Back Better failure | Broader package collapsed |
| CTC prioritized | Limited political capital |

### 2022-2024: Reversion

After 2021:
- Childless worker EITC reverted to minimal levels
- Age restrictions returned (25-64)
- Investment income limit remains (one lasting change)
- Approximately 17 million workers affected by reversion

## Lessons from History

### What Has Worked

| Success | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Work incentive | Labor force participation increased |
| Poverty reduction | Millions lifted out annually |
| Political durability | Survived across administrations |
| Bipartisan support | Both parties have expanded |
| State supplements | 31 states added own credits |

### Persistent Challenges

| Challenge | Duration |
|-----------|----------|
| Childless worker gap | Since 1994 |
| Improper payments | Ongoing |
| Participation gaps | Ongoing |
| Annual lump sum timing | Design feature, not changed |
| Complexity | Increased with refinements |

### Key Observations

1. **EITC expanded with both parties in power**: Genuine bipartisan achievement
2. **Work focus sustained support**: Unlike cash welfare
3. **Childless workers consistently shortchanged**: Token credit since 1994
4. **Compliance concerns shaped enforcement**: Sometimes over-deterring eligible
5. **State programs filled gaps**: 31 states now supplement
6. **2021 showed what's possible**: But expansion not made permanent
