# Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC): Overview

## Executive Summary

The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is America's largest anti-poverty program for working families, delivering $64 billion annually to 31 million households. This refundable tax credit rewards work by supplementing the earnings of low- and moderate-income workers, lifting 5.6 million people out of poverty each year. The EITC enjoys bipartisan support as a work-based approach to poverty reduction, having been expanded by presidents of both parties since its creation in 1975.

Despite its success, the EITC has significant gaps. Childless workers receive only a token credit (maximum $600 versus $7,430 for families with three or more children), effectively excluding 25 million low-wage workers without qualifying children. Age restrictions exclude workers under 25 and over 64, and approximately 20% of eligible families fail to claim the credit they have earned. Improper payment rates of approximately 25% reflect documentation challenges rather than widespread fraud, yet generate political attacks on the program.

The EITC's structure--with phase-in, plateau, and phase-out ranges--creates complex incentives for work and marriage that vary by income level and family structure. Understanding these dynamics is essential for designing improvements that maximize the credit's poverty-reducing potential while maintaining its work incentive foundation.

## The Core Program

### EITC Basics

**What It Is**

The Earned Income Tax Credit is a refundable federal tax credit for low- and moderate-income working individuals and families. "Refundable" means that if the credit exceeds taxes owed, the family receives the difference as a cash refund.

**Who Qualifies (2024)**

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| Earned income | Must have wages or self-employment income |
| Income limits | Vary by filing status and number of children |
| Investment income | Cannot exceed $11,600 |
| Filing status | Cannot file Married Filing Separately |
| Citizenship/residency | US citizen or resident alien |
| Age (childless) | 25-64 (expanded from 25-64 pre-2021) |

**2024 Income Limits and Maximum Credits**

| Number of Children | Maximum Credit | Income Limit (Single/HoH) | Income Limit (Married) |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| 0 | $632 | $18,591 | $25,511 |
| 1 | $4,213 | $49,084 | $56,004 |
| 2 | $6,960 | $55,768 | $62,688 |
| 3+ | $7,830 | $59,899 | $66,819 |

### How the Credit Works

**The Three-Phase Structure**

Credit
Amount
  ^
  |         Plateau
  |    /--------------\
  |   /                \
  |  /                  \
  | /                    \
  |/                      \
  +--------------------------> Income
   Phase-in   Plateau  Phase-out

```

**1. Phase-In Range**

- Credit increases with each dollar of earnings
- Encourages entry into workforce
- Rate: 7.65% (childless) to 45% (3+ children)
- Creates strong work incentive

**2. Plateau Range**

- Credit remains at maximum
- Neither increases nor decreases with income
- Neutral work incentive zone

**3. Phase-Out Range**

- Credit decreases as income rises
- Rate: 7.65% (childless) to 21.06% (2+ children)
- Creates implicit marginal tax rate
- Combines with payroll tax and income tax

## Key Concepts

### Work Incentives

**Extensive Margin (Whether to Work)**

The EITC strongly encourages entering the workforce:
- Each dollar of initial earnings generates up to 45 cents of credit
- Combined with wages, can nearly double low earnings
- Research shows significant increase in labor force participation, especially among single mothers

**Intensive Margin (How Much to Work)**

Effects vary by income range:
- Phase-in: Strong incentive to work more
- Plateau: Neutral
- Phase-out: Disincentive (each additional dollar reduces credit)

**Research Findings**

| Finding | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Increased labor force participation | Single mothers up 6-8 percentage points |
| Hours effect | Mixed; small or no reduction |
| Net employment effect | Positive |
| Wage effects | Some evidence of wage depression |

### Marriage Effects

**Marriage Penalties**

When two earners marry:
- Combined income may push into higher phase-out
- Credit can drop significantly
- Especially affects two moderate earners

**Marriage Bonuses**

When low earner marries non-earner:
- Combined income on one return
- May shift into higher credit range
- Higher income limits for married filers

**Magnitude**

| Scenario | Typical Penalty/Bonus |
|----------|----------------------|
| Two minimum wage earners | Penalty up to $2,000+ |
| One earner + non-earner | Bonus up to $1,000+ |
| Mixed-income couples | Varies widely |

### Qualifying Children

**Requirements**

| Test | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Age | Under 19, or under 24 if student, or permanently disabled |
| Relationship | Child, stepchild, foster child, sibling, niece/nephew, or descendant |
| Residency | Lived with taxpayer for more than half the year |
| Support | Cannot provide more than half own support |
| Joint return | Cannot file joint return (with exceptions) |

**Tiebreaker Rules**

When multiple people could claim same child:
1. Parent over non-parent
2. Parent with longer residency
3. Parent with higher AGI
4. Non-parent with higher AGI

## Framework for Analysis

### Comparing EITC to Other Approaches

| Approach | Work Incentive | Simplicity | Coverage |
|----------|----------------|------------|----------|
| EITC | Strong (phase-in) | Complex | Workers only |
| Minimum wage | Moderate | Simple | All workers |
| Cash transfers | None/weak | Varies | Can be universal |
| Child allowance | None | Simple | All children |
| NIT (negative income tax) | Weak | Moderate | All low-income |

### Interaction with Other Programs

**Combined Benefit Structure**

| Program | Interaction |
|---------|-------------|
| SNAP | EITC income counts; can reduce SNAP |
| Medicaid | EITC income counted for eligibility |
| Housing assistance | EITC income may affect rent calculation |
| CTC | Combined forms family support |
| Payroll taxes | Offset (EITC ~ 7.65% rate for childless) |

**Benefits Cliff Considerations**

- EITC phase-out adds to marginal tax rate
- Combined with payroll tax, income tax, benefit phase-outs
- Effective marginal rates can exceed 50%
- Cliff effects less severe than some means-tested programs

## Why This Matters

- Addresses market failure in low-wage labor markets

### For Policy

- Demonstrates bipartisan anti-poverty approach
- Work-based framing maintains support
