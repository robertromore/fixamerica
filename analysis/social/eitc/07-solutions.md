# Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC): Solutions

## Overview

The EITC is already one of America's most effective anti-poverty programs, but significant improvements are possible. Solutions focus on three areas: expanding the credit to reach more workers and provide adequate support, simplifying administration to reduce errors and increase participation, and improving delivery to get benefits to families when needed. This document presents comprehensive reforms ranging from immediately achievable to transformative.

## Expand the Childless Worker EITC

### The Problem

The childless worker EITC is woefully inadequate:

| Metric | Childless | Family (3+ children) | Gap |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|-----|
| Maximum credit | $632 | $7,830 | 12x |
| Average credit | $290 | $5,800 | 20x |
| Income limit | $18,591 | $59,899 | 3x |
| Phase-in rate | 7.65% | 45% | 6x |

### Proposal: Triple the Childless Worker EITC

**Make 2021 Expansion Permanent and Improve**

| Parameter | Current | Proposal |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Maximum credit | $632 | $1,800+ |
| Phase-in rate | 7.65% | 15.3% |
| Age minimum | 25 | 18 |
| Age maximum | 64 | None |
| Income limit (single) | $18,591 | $25,000+ |

**Impact**

- Would reach 17 million additional workers
- Lift 1+ million out of poverty
- Average credit increase from $290 to $800+
- Particularly help young workers, older workers

**Cost**

- 10-year cost: $135-150 billion
- Annual cost: $13-15 billion

### Age Limit Reform

**Current Restrictions**

| Restriction | Excluded Population |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Minimum age 25 | 6 million young workers |
| Maximum age 64 | 3 million older workers |

**Proposal: Eliminate Age Restrictions**

| Age Group | Change |
|-----------|--------|
| 18-24 | Include all (not just full-time students) |
| 65+ | Include all working seniors |
| Former foster youth | Already included (make permanent) |
| Homeless youth | Already included (make permanent) |

**Impact**

- Include 9+ million additional workers
- Recognize work at any age deserves support
- Remove arbitrary cutoffs

## Strengthen the Family EITC

### Increase Credit Amounts

**Proposal: Increase Phase-In Rates and Maximum Credits**

| Children | Current Max | Proposed Max | Increase |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| 1 child | $4,213 | $5,000 | +19% |
| 2 children | $6,960 | $8,000 | +15% |
| 3+ children | $7,830 | $9,500 | +21% |

**Rationale**

- Offset inflation erosion
- Better match living costs
- Reduce poverty more effectively
- Maintain work incentive

### Address Marriage Penalties

**Current Problem**

Two earners marrying can lose $1,000-2,500 in EITC due to combined income pushing into phase-out.

**Proposal: Second Earner Credit**

| Component | Design |
|-----------|--------|
| Additional credit | 20% of second earner's income up to $5,000 |
| Maximum bonus | $1,000 |
| Phase-out | Coordinated with primary EITC |
| Effect | Offset marriage penalty |

**Alternative: Higher Married Thresholds**

| Change | Current | Proposal |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Additional threshold | $6,920 | $15,000 |
| Effect | Later phase-out for married |
| Cost | Moderate |

## Improve Participation

### The Problem

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Participation rate | 78-80% |
| Eligible non-claimants | 5-6 million |
| Unclaimed credits | $8-10 billion annually |

### Proposal: Automatic Enrollment

**IRS-Initiated Claims**

| Component | Design |
|-----------|--------|
| Data matching | Use W-2, SSA data to identify eligible |
| Pre-populated returns | Fill in known information |
| Outreach | Contact non-filers |
| Simplified filing | One-page form for EITC-only |

**Who Would Benefit**

| Population | Barrier Addressed |
|------------|-------------------|
| Very low income | Don't need to file otherwise |
| Non-English speakers | Language barriers |
| Homeless | Documentation challenges |
| Elderly | Complexity |

### Enhanced Outreach

**Current EITC Awareness Day**

- Annual campaign in January
- Limited reach
- Mostly through tax preparers

**Proposal: Year-Round Outreach**

| Channel | Activity |
|---------|----------|
| Employer notification | Require notice to low-wage workers |
| Benefits offices | Integrate with SNAP, Medicaid applications |
| Community organizations | Fund grassroots outreach |
| Schools | Inform parents at schools |
| Healthcare | Mention at community health centers |

### Expand VITA

**Current Capacity**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Sites | 11,000+ |
| Returns | 3.5 million |
| EITC claims | 40% of returns |
| Funding | $30 million IRS grants |

**Proposal: Double VITA Capacity**

| Investment | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| $100 million annual funding | Expand sites, volunteers |
| Paid coordinators | Professional management |
| Year-round sites | Not just tax season |
| Technology | Better software, tablets |
| Partnerships | Libraries, schools, community centers |

## Simplify Administration

### The Problem

| Issue | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| Complex qualifying child rules | 50%+ of errors |
| Self-employment verification | Hard to document |
| Residency proof | Informal arrangements |
| Tiebreaker rules | Multiple claimants |

### Simplify Qualifying Child Rules

**Current Complexity**

| Test | Difficulty |
|------|------------|
| Age | Simple |
| Relationship | Moderate |
| Residency | Complex |
| Support | Complex |
| Joint return | Complex |

**Proposal: Simplified Residency Test**

| Current | Proposed |
|---------|----------|
| "More than half the year" | "Primary residence" attestation |
| Documentation required | Self-attestation with verification |
| Multiple claimants litigated | Default to custodial parent |

**Impact**

- Reduce errors by 50%
- Reduce audit burden
- Maintain eligibility targeting

### Self-Employment Safe Harbor

**Current Problem**

- Self-employment income hard to verify
- Leads to over- and under-reporting
- Audit risk for gig workers

**Proposal: Safe Harbor Options**

| Option | Design |
|--------|--------|
| Standard deduction | 25% of gross self-employment |
| Minimum income assumption | For gig workers with 1099s |
| Simplified reporting | App-based income integration |

### Reduce Improper Payments Through Technology

**Current Challenge**

- 23-27% improper payment rate
- Paper-based verification
- Limited data matching

**Proposal: Real-Time Verification**

| Investment | Purpose |
|------------|---------|

| Risk-based review | Focus on high-risk claims |
| Simplify rules | Fewer errors to catch |
| Default to payment | Burden on IRS, not claimant |

## Improve Delivery

### Advance Payment Option

**The Case for Advance**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Annual lump sum | Monthly payments |
| Delayed help | Real-time support |
| Payday loan substitute | Regular income |
| Volatility | Smoothed consumption |

**Proposal: Voluntary Monthly EITC**

| Component | Design |
|-----------|--------|
| Opt-in | Claimant chooses monthly or annual |
| Amount | 80% of estimated credit monthly |
| Reconciliation | True-up at year end |
| Administration | IRS direct deposit |

**Addressing Concerns**

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Overpayment risk | Pay 80%; reconcile at year end |
| Administrative complexity | Technology has improved |
| Prior failure | New design, direct IRS payment |
| Preference for lump sum | Make optional |

### Savings Opportunities

**EITC and Savings**

- Lump sum creates savings opportunity
- But most spent on immediate needs
- Could encourage asset building

**Proposal: EITC Savings Match**

| Component | Design |
|-----------|--------|
| Match rate | 50% of savings up to $500 |
| Maximum match | $250 |
| Savings vehicle | IRA, 529, or savings account |
