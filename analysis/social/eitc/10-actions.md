## Immediate Actions (Today)

### Claim Your Credit

**If You May Be Eligible**

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Check eligibility | Use IRS EITC Assistant (irs.gov/eitc) |
| Gather documents | W-2s, 1099s, Social Security cards |
| File your return | Even if you don't owe taxes |
| Consider free filing | VITA, Free File, GetYourRefund.org |

**Don't Leave Money Unclaimed**

- $8-10 billion in EITC goes unclaimed annually
- Average unclaimed: $1,500-2,000
- Can claim prior 3 years if missed

### Spread Awareness

| Action | Time | Impact |
|--------|------|--------|
| Share EITC eligibility info | 10 min | Help others claim |
| Post during tax season | 5 min | Raise awareness |
| Tell friends/family | 15 min | Personal outreach |
| Share VITA locations | 5 min | Connect to free help |

**Key Messages to Share**

- 31 million families receive EITC; you might be eligible
- Credits up to $7,830 for families, $632 for childless workers
- Free tax preparation available through VITA
- 20% of eligible workers don't claim; don't miss out
- IRS EITC Assistant can check eligibility in minutes

### Contact Representatives

**Federal Officials**

| Official | Contact | Message |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Senators | senate.gov | Expand childless worker EITC |
| Representative | house.gov | Support EITC Enhancement Act |
| White House | whitehouse.gov/contact | Prioritize working families |

**State Officials**

| Official | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| State legislators | Create or expand state EITC |
| Governor | Budget priority |

**Sample Message: Federal**

> I urge you to make the 2021 childless worker EITC expansion permanent. The current maximum credit of $632 for childless workers is only 1/12th of what families with children receive. The 2021 expansion to $1,502 showed we can do better. 17 million workers benefited. Please support legislation to expand the EITC for all workers.

**Sample Message: State (No EITC)**

> I urge you to create a state Earned Income Tax Credit. 31 states plus DC have state EITCs that supplement the federal credit and help working families. A state EITC of 30% of the federal credit would put money in the pockets of [state] workers and boost our local economy.
