# Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC): Overview

The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is America's largest anti-poverty program for working families, delivering $64 billion annually to 31 million households. This refundable tax credit rewards work by supplementing the earnings of low- and moderate-income workers, lifting 5.6 million people out of poverty each year. The EITC enjoys bipartisan support as a work-based approach to poverty reduction, having been expanded by presidents of both parties since its creation in 1975.
