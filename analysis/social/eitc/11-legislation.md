# Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC): Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

EITC reform requires legislative action primarily through amendments to the Internal Revenue Code. This document provides model legislation for federal expansion, state EITC creation, administrative improvements, and simplification. The legislation addresses the childless worker gap, age restrictions, participation barriers, and program integrity while maintaining the work-based foundation that gives the EITC its bipartisan appeal.

## Federal Legislation

### EITC Enhancement Act

**Purpose**: Permanently expand the Earned Income Tax Credit for childless workers and remove age restrictions.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "EITC Enhancement Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Earned Income Tax Credit is the largest federal program
    for lifting working families out of poverty, providing $64
    billion to 31 million families annually.
(2) Childless workers receive a maximum credit of $632, compared
    to $7,830 for families with three or more children, a ratio
    of 1 to 12.
(3) The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 temporarily expanded the
    childless worker credit to $1,502 and expanded age eligibility,
    providing meaningful support to 17 million workers.
(4) Upon expiration of the temporary expansion, childless workers
    returned to receiving only token support.
(5) Workers aged 19-24 and 65 and over are arbitrarily excluded
    from the credit despite facing the same low-wage work
    challenges as other adults.
(6) Making the 2021 expansion permanent would recognize that all
    workers deserve meaningful support and would lift over one
    million additional people out of poverty.

SEC. 3. PERMANENT EXPANSION OF CREDIT FOR INDIVIDUALS
        WITHOUT QUALIFYING CHILDREN.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 32(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code
    of 1986 is amended—

        inserting "15.3 percent"; and
    (2) by striking paragraph (B) and inserting the following:
        "(B) INDIVIDUALS WITH NO QUALIFYING CHILDREN.—In the
            case of an eligible individual with no qualifying
            children, the credit percentage and phaseout
            percentage shall each be 15.3 percent."

(b) EARNED INCOME AMOUNT.—Section 32(b)(2)(A) of such Code is
    amended by striking "$4,220" in the table therein and
    inserting "$9,820" for individuals with no qualifying
    children.

(c) PHASEOUT AMOUNT.—Section 32(b)(2)(A) of such Code is
    amended by striking the applicable amounts for individuals
    with no qualifying children and inserting:
    "$11,610 for single filers and heads of households, and
    $17,550 for joint filers."

(d) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendments made by this section shall
    apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.

SEC. 4. ELIMINATION OF AGE REQUIREMENTS FOR CHILDLESS
        WORKERS.

    Code of 1986 is amended—
    (1) by striking clause (II) and inserting the following:
        "(II) who has attained age 18 before the close of the
            taxable year,"; and
    (2) by striking clause (III).

(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.—Section 32(c)(1)(A)(ii) is further
    amended by striking "and has not attained age 65 before
    the close of such taxable year".

    exceeding $4,000.

(d) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendments made by this section shall
    apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.

SEC. 5. INFLATION ADJUSTMENTS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 32(j) of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986 is amended to ensure that all amounts applicable to
    individuals without qualifying children are adjusted for
    inflation in the same manner as amounts for individuals
    with qualifying children.

(b) BASE YEAR.—For purposes of inflation adjustment, the base
    year shall be 2024.

SEC. 6. COORDINATION WITH OTHER CREDITS.

(a) NONDUPLICATION.—The amendments made by this Act shall be
    coordinated with the child tax credit under section 24 to
    prevent duplication of benefits while maximizing support
    for working families.

SEC. 7. REVENUE OFFSET.

(a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue guidance to
    implement the amendments made by this Act in a manner
    consistent with available appropriations.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Congress that the
    costs of this Act should be offset through increased
    taxation of high-income individuals and corporations or
    through reductions in tax expenditures benefiting high-
    income taxpayers.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

Except as otherwise provided, this Act shall apply to taxable
years beginning after December 31, 2024.

- **Section 5**: Ensures inflation adjustment for all parameters
- **Section 6**: Coordinates with Child Tax Credit
- **Section 7**: Addresses revenue considerations

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Cost ($135 billion over 10 years) | Revenue options available; investment in workers |

### Working Families Tax Relief Act

**Purpose**: Comprehensive EITC expansion including marriage penalty relief, advance payment option, and increased credits for families.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

    can be improved to better serve families.
(3) Marriage penalties in the EITC can reduce credits by
    $1,000-2,500 when two earners marry.
(4) Annual lump-sum payments may not optimally meet families'
    monthly needs.
(5) Increased support through expanded credits, marriage penalty
    relief, and advance payment options will strengthen working
    families.

SEC. 3. INCREASED CREDIT AMOUNTS FOR FAMILIES.

        (1) IN GENERAL.—In the case of a joint return where
            both spouses have earned income, the credit
            otherwise determined under this section shall be
            increased by 20 percent of the lesser of—
            (A) $5,000, or
            (B) the earned income of the spouse with the lower
                earned income.
        (2) MAXIMUM ADDITIONAL CREDIT.—The additional credit
            under paragraph (1) shall not exceed $1,000.

        year or upon beginning qualifying employment.
    (3) Elections may be modified or revoked at any time.

(c) MONTHLY PAYMENT AMOUNT.—
    (1) The monthly payment shall equal one-twelfth of 80
        percent of the estimated annual credit.
    (2) Estimation shall be based on prior year income or
        current year projections.

(d) RECONCILIATION.—
    (1) At the end of the taxable year, the actual credit shall
        be computed and reconciled with advance payments.
    (2) If advance payments exceed the actual credit, the
        difference shall be repaid, except that—
        (A) repayment may be waived for amounts under $500 due

| Prior advance failure | New design with direct IRS payment, not employer |
| Overpayment risk | Waiver for small amounts; installment repayment |
| IRS capacity | Significant appropriation for implementation |

| Married filing separately | Historical; could be reconsidered |
| Immigration status | Existing exclusions constitutional |

**Due Process**

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Audit procedures | Must provide notice and opportunity |
| Disallowance | Appeal rights required |
| Multi-year bans | Constitutional but requires process |
| Advance payment recoupment | Reasonable procedures required |

### IRS Authority

| Area | Authority Level |
|------|-----------------|
| Form development | Broad discretion |
| Audit procedures | Broad discretion |
| Eligibility interpretation | Subject to statute |
| Safe harbors | Regulatory authority |
| Data sharing | Statutory limitations |

### State Authority

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### EITC Enhancement Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Income manipulation | Self-employed may inflate/deflate income | Medium |
| Age verification | Difficult to verify age for young workers without ID | Low |
| Student threshold gaming | Students may manipulate earnings to reach $4,000 | Low |
| Residency attestation abuse | False claims of independent residence | Medium |
| Multiple claims | Different filers claiming same individual | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Still work-conditioned | Excludes non-workers in deep poverty | Design choice |
| Annual payment | Doesn't address monthly needs | Administrative |
| Complex interactions | Benefits cliff with other programs persists | Cross-program |
| State variation | Federal-only in 19 states | Federalism |
| Participation gap | 20% still won't claim | Information/access |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Income manipulation**: Strengthen third-party reporting for gig workers; require platform reporting; establish safe harbors for reasonable estimates
2. **Age verification**: Accept multiple forms of ID; allow SSA data matching; provide pathways for undocumented
3. **Student threshold**: Monitor patterns; adjust threshold if gaming observed; consider hours-based alternative
4. **Residency attestation**: Risk-based verification; data matching with utility/school records; penalty for false attestation
5. **Multiple claims**: Enhanced data matching to identify conflicts; default rules to resolve
6. **Non-worker exclusion**: Consider separate program for non-workers or NIT supplement
7. **Monthly needs**: Implement advance payment option (see Working Families Tax Relief Act)
8. **Benefits cliffs**: Coordinate with SNAP, Medicaid, housing reform; gradual phase-outs
9. **State variation**: Federal incentives for state EITCs; consider federal floor
10. **Participation**: Automatic enrollment pilots; expanded VITA; employer notification requirements

3. **Second earner credit**: Clear allocation rules; W-2 data matching
4. **Marriage timing**: Annualize income; anti-abuse rules for same-year marriage/divorce
5. **Employer collusion**: Third-party reporting; pattern detection
6. **Complexity**: Extensive outreach; simple enrollment; default options
7. **Reconciliation burden**: Waive small overpayments; generous installment terms; hardship waivers
8. **IRS capacity**: Multi-year implementation; phased rollout; significant appropriation
9. **Overpayment visibility**: Communicate as investment; compare to other programs

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|

3. **Tiebreaker manipulation**: Default to legal custody; require documentation for non-default claims
4. **Data matching gaps**: Continuous improvement; multiple data sources; machine learning
5. **Audit reduction concerns**: Shift to pre-payment verification where efficient; maintain deterrence through penalties
6. **Privacy**: Strong data protection; limited use; regular audits of data handling
7. **Technology**: Multi-year modernization investment; prioritize EITC systems
8. **Complexity**: Continue statutory simplification; plain-language guidance
9. **Preparer reliance**: Expand VITA; improve Free File; simplified online tools
10. **Audit deterrence**: Risk-based approach; focus on high-risk; protect legitimate claimants

### State Model Legislation

6. **No-income-tax states**: Alternative delivery (direct payment); consider income tax for this purpose
7. **Political vulnerability**: Build constituency; make universal elements; demonstrate impact
8. **Administrative variation**: Best practice sharing; technical assistance

### Cross-Cutting Issues

#### Systemic Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Affects | Mitigation |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| Work requirement | All EITC legislation | Consider NIT complement for non-workers |
| Annual accounting | All EITC legislation | Advance payment; real-time eligibility |
| Filing requirement | All EITC legislation | Auto-enrollment; simplified filing |
| Benefits cliffs | All EITC interaction | Cross-program coordination |
| Political reversibility | All EITC legislation | Build broad constituency; bipartisan design |

#### Monitoring Requirements

| Metric | Frequency | Entity |
