# Cash Assistance: Stakeholders

## Who Benefits from the Status Quo

### State Governments

States benefit from TANF's flexibility in several ways:

**Budget Flexibility**:

- Block grant funds can supplant state spending
- Unspent funds carry over
- "Other" spending category allows wide discretion
- Cash assistance reduction frees funds for other uses

**Political Cover**:

- Caseload reduction claims "success"
- Work requirements popular with voters
- State control allows responsiveness to local politics
- Avoids federal accountability

**Key States Benefiting Most**:

- States using TANF for non-cash purposes
- States with lowest TANF-to-poverty ratios
- States with "welfare reform success" narratives

### Low-Wage Employers

Businesses benefit from TANF's work requirements:

**Labor Supply Effects**:

- Mandatory work participation increases worker availability
- Desperate workers accept any conditions
- Reduces bargaining power of low-wage workforce
- Subsidized child care lowers effective wages needed

**Industries Most Affected**:

- Fast food and food service
- Retail
- Hospitality
- Care work (home health, child care)
- Agriculture

### Conservative Advocacy Organizations

Groups that shaped 1996 reform continue benefiting:

- Heritage Foundation
- American Enterprise Institute
- Cato Institute
- State-level affiliates

**Ideological Wins**:

- Work requirements as model for other programs
- Block grant approach applicable elsewhere
- Reduction of federal role
- Narrative control over "welfare reform success"

### Contractors and Service Providers

Privatization created beneficiaries:

- Welfare-to-work contractors (Maximus, Lockheed Martin)
- Job training providers
- Drug testing companies
- Child support enforcement contractors

## Who Is Harmed

### Families in Poverty

The primary victims of TANF's failures:

**2 million current recipients**:

- Inadequate benefits below 60% of poverty in all states
- Punitive sanctions that remove entire families
- Time limits that cut off assistance arbitrarily
- Surveillance and humiliation in application process

**Poor families not receiving TANF**:

- 79% of poor families (roughly 7 million families) receive nothing
- Denied at application
- Deterred from applying
- Exhausted time limits
- Sanctioned off program

**Demographic Impact**:

- Single mothers: Vast majority of adult recipients
- Children: 75% of all recipients; 1.5 million affected
- Black and Hispanic families: Disproportionately impacted
- Rural families: Limited services and opportunities

### Children

Children experience TANF's failures most directly:

**Material Hardship**:

- Food insecurity
- Housing instability
- Utility shutoffs
- Inadequate clothing and supplies

**Developmental Impacts**:

- Toxic stress from poverty
- School mobility and disruption
- Health problems
- Limited opportunities

**Long-Term Consequences**:

- Lower educational attainment
- Health problems into adulthood
- Intergenerational poverty transmission
- Reduced lifetime earnings

### Workers in Low-Wage Labor Market

TANF's work requirements affect the broader low-wage workforce:

- Downward wage pressure from increased labor supply
- Reduced bargaining power
- Worse working conditions tolerated
- Less ability to leave bad jobs

### Communities of Color

Racial disparities pervade TANF:

- Stricter policies in states with larger Black populations
- Documented disparate treatment by caseworkers
- Lower benefits in the South
- Historical continuity with exclusionary welfare

## Who Has Power to Change Things

### Federal Government

**Congress**:

- Sets TANF funding levels
- Defines block grant structure
- Establishes work requirements and time limits
- Could convert to entitlement or matching grant

**Executive Branch**:

- HHS issues guidance on TANF implementation
- Can encourage states to reform
- Limited enforcement tools under current law
- Could prioritize TANF in budget proposals

### State Governments

**Governors**:

- Set administrative priorities
- Appoint welfare directors
- Propose budgets and benefit levels
- Sign or veto legislation

**State Legislatures**:

- Appropriate TANF funds
- Set benefit levels
- Establish eligibility rules
- Determine sanction policies

**State Agencies**:

- Implement day-to-day policy
- Train caseworkers
- Set administrative procedures
- Collect and report data

### Courts

**Federal Courts**:

- Limited role given block grant structure
- Due process challenges still possible
- Civil rights enforcement

**State Courts**:

- State constitutional claims
- Administrative procedure challenges
- Individual benefit disputes

## Potential Allies

### Advocacy Organizations

**National Groups**:

- Center on Budget and Policy Priorities
- CLASP (Center for Law and Social Policy)
- National Women's Law Center
- First Focus on Children
- Children's Defense Fund

**State-Level Groups**:

- State-based policy organizations
- Legal aid organizations
- Community action agencies
- Faith-based organizations

### Labor Movement

**Unions**:

- SEIU (represents many low-wage workers)
- AFSCME (represents some caseworkers)
- AFL-CIO (policy advocacy)

**Worker Centers**:

- Organizing low-wage workers
- Connecting welfare and work issues
- Advocating for wage increases

### Academic Researchers

Key voices for evidence-based reform:

- University poverty research centers
- Public policy schools
- Economists studying safety net programs
- Sociologists documenting TANF impacts

### Recipient-Led Organizations

Those with direct experience:

- Welfare Rights Initiative
- Poor People's Campaign
- Local recipient advocacy groups
- Domestic Violence Coalition (work requirement exemptions)

## Key Relationships

### Federal-State Dynamic

The core tension in TANF:

- Federal funding with state control
- Limited accountability for outcomes
- States resist federal mandates
- Block grant structure limits leverage

### Employer-Worker-State Triangle

Work requirements create complex dynamics:

- States push recipients toward work
- Employers benefit from labor supply
- Workers have limited bargaining power
- Subsidies flow to employers through workers

### Advocate-Policymaker Relationship

Reform requires building connections:

- Researchers provide evidence
- Advocates translate to policy proposals
- Policymakers need political cover
- Recipients provide testimony and legitimacy

### Coalition Building Needs

Effective reform requires:

- Child welfare advocates (child poverty)
- Women's organizations (single mothers)
- Civil rights groups (racial justice)
- Labor organizations (worker rights)
- Faith communities (moral imperative)
