# Cash Assistance: Overview

Cash assistance programs represent America's most direct approach to alleviating poverty, yet they reach fewer families than ever before. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, created in 1996 to replace Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), now reaches only 21 of every 100 poor families compared to 68 in 1996. The $16.5 billion block grant has been frozen since 1997, losing 40% of its value to inflation. With approximately 2 million recipients and benefit levels below 60% of the poverty line in all states, TANF has evolved from a cash safety net into a flexible funding source that states largely redirect away from direct assistance.
