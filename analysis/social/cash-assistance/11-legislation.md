# Cash Assistance: Legislation

## Overview

Cash assistance legislation operates primarily at the federal level through the TANF block grant structure, with extensive state discretion in implementation. Federal reform requires amending the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), which created TANF. State legislation can improve benefits, eligibility, and administration within the federal framework. This document presents model federal legislation to fundamentally reform TANF, along with state-level reforms and regulatory approaches.

## Federal Legislation

### TANF Modernization Act

**Purpose**: Replace the fixed block grant with an entitlement structure that responds to need, establishes minimum standards, and promotes family economic security.

**Draft Text**:

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "TANF Modernization Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that:
(1) The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
program reaches only 21 of every 100 families in poverty,
compared to 68 of 100 in 1996.
(2) The $16.5 billion block grant has been frozen since
1997 and has lost 40 percent of its value to inflation.
(3) TANF benefits are below 60 percent of the poverty
line in all 50 states.
(4) Only 24 percent of TANF funds are used for basic
cash assistance.
(5) TANF failed to respond adequately to the Great
Recession and COVID-19 pandemic.
(6) Racial disparities in TANF administration have been
documented across states.
(7) Reform is necessary to fulfill the program's purpose
of providing assistance to needy families.

## Regulatory Framework

### HHS TANF Administration Guidance

**Authority**: 42 U.S.C. 604 (authority to issue regulations)

**Draft Guidance**:

```text
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
Administration for Children and Families

TANF PROGRAM INSTRUCTION

TO: State TANF Directors
FROM: Assistant Secretary for Children and Families
RE: TANF Administration to Promote Family Economic Security

PURPOSE: This guidance establishes priorities for TANF
administration to ensure the program serves its intended
purpose of providing assistance to needy families.

1. CASH ASSISTANCE PRIORITY

States should prioritize cash assistance as the primary
purpose of TANF. The Department will:
- Monitor cash assistance spending as percentage of total
- Require detailed reporting on "other" spending category
- Provide technical assistance on redirecting funds to
  cash assistance

2. APPLICATION ACCESS

States should ensure accessible application processes:
- Online applications available statewide
- Same-day processing for urgent need
- Presumptive eligibility pending verification
- No documentation requirements beyond federal minimums
- Assistance with applications provided

3. SANCTION POLICIES

States should implement proportionate sanction policies:
- Partial sanctions preferred over full-family sanctions
- Good cause provisions broadly interpreted
- Due process protections enforced
- Cure periods before sanction implementation
- Automatic restoration upon compliance

4. WORK REQUIREMENTS

States should implement work requirements that promote
long-term success:
- Education and training counted toward requirements
- Barrier assessment before work assignment
- Reasonable accommodations for disabilities
- Child care and transportation provided
- Job quality considered in placements

5. RACIAL EQUITY

States should address racial disparities:
- Collect and report disaggregated data
- Conduct disparity analysis annually
- Implement corrective action for identified disparities
- Train caseworkers on implicit bias
- Engage communities in program design

6. PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT

States should be evaluated on:
- Poverty reduction, not caseload reduction
- Employment quality, not just employment
- Family stability and well-being
- Equity across demographic groups
- Access (TANF-to-poverty ratio)

EFFECTIVE DATE: This guidance is effective immediately.
```

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

**Spending Power**:

- TANF operates under Congress's spending power (Art. I, Sec. 8)
- Conditions on federal funds must be related to federal interest
- Clear statement required for conditions
- *South Dakota v. Dole* framework applies

**Entitlement Structure**:

- No constitutional requirement to provide welfare
- But once created, due process applies (*Goldberg v. Kelly*)
- Individual right approach constitutionally permissible
- Block grant structure is policy choice, not constitutional mandate

### Federalism Questions

**State Discretion**:

- Current TANF provides extensive state flexibility
- Federal minimum standards permissible as condition of funding
- States may provide more than federal minimum
- Cannot commandeer state officials but can attach conditions

**Preemption**:

- Federal law does not preempt more generous state policies
- States can eliminate time limits using state funds
- State civil rights laws may apply to TANF administration

### Enforcement Mechanisms

**Federal**:

- Withholding of federal funds for non-compliance
- Technical assistance and corrective action plans
- Data collection and public reporting
- Civil rights enforcement (Title VI)

**State**:

- State administrative procedures
- State court review of benefit decisions
- State legislature oversight
- State auditor review

**Private**:

- Limited private right of action under current law
- 42 U.S.C. 1983 for constitutional violations
- State law remedies may be available
- Legal aid representation in administrative proceedings

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Block grant flexibility | States redirect funds from cash assistance | Critical |
| Diversion at application | States discourage applications without formal denial | High |
| Work requirement gaming | States count activities that don't help families | High |
| Sanction churning | Families sanctioned off then reapply | Moderate |
| Data underreporting | States don't accurately report outcomes | Moderate |
| Time limit extensions | Exemptions not granted even when warranted | High |
| Supplantation | Federal funds replace rather than supplement state spending | High |
| Contractor incentives | Welfare-to-work contractors paid for placements, not outcomes | Moderate |
| Appeals barriers | Complex process discourages appeals of denials | Moderate |
| Documentation requirements | Excessive verification requirements exclude eligible families | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Frozen block grant | Real funding declined 40% since 1997 | No indexing in original legislation |
| State race to bottom | Benefits inadequate in all states | No federal minimum standards |
| Work-first ideology | Education and training devalued | 1996 reform priorities |
| Racial disparities | Black families treated differently | Structural racism, caseworker discretion |
| No entitlement | Eligible families denied assistance | 1996 elimination of individual right |
| Time limits arbitrary | Families cut off despite continued need | Ideological commitment to time limits |
| Child impact ignored | Children harmed by family sanctions | Focus on adult behavior |
| Counter-cyclical failure | TANF doesn't respond to recessions | Fixed block grant structure |
| Political invisibility | Recipients have no political power | Stigma, low voter participation |
| Evaluation gaps | Limited data on long-term outcomes | Insufficient federal requirements |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Block Grant Replacement**: Convert to matching grant structure with counter-cyclical triggers. Require cash assistance spending floor of 50%. Establish oversight of "other" category spending.

2. **Minimum Benefit Standards**: Establish federal floor at 50% of poverty. Index to inflation automatically. Provide federal supplement to low-capacity states.

3. **Diversion Prevention**: Require formal determination for all applicants. Track application-to-approval rates. Private right of action for wrongful denial.

4. **Work Requirement Reform**: Expand countable activities to include education. Require job quality standards for placements. Increase exemptions for barriers.

5. **Sanction Limits**: Require partial sanctions only. Protect children's portion of benefit. Mandate due process and cure periods.

6. **Time Limit Reform**: Eliminate federal time limit or expand exemptions. Prohibit state time limits shorter than federal. Reset previously accumulated time.

7. **Racial Equity Enforcement**: Require disaggregated data collection. Conduct disparity impact assessments. Mandate corrective action for documented disparities.

8. **Accountability Mechanisms**: Shift performance measures from caseload to poverty reduction. Public reporting on outcomes. Technical assistance and enforcement.

9. **Appeals Access**: Simplify appeals process. Provide legal representation. Continue benefits pending appeal.

10. **Documentation Reform**: Accept self-attestation where possible. Limit verification requirements to federal minimum. Provide assistance with documentation.

### General Implementation Concerns

**Transition Challenges**:

- States structured around current flexibility
- IT systems may need updates
- Staff training required
- Political resistance from state officials

**Funding Sustainability**:

- Matching grant more expensive in downturns
- Requires ongoing appropriations commitment
- State budget capacity varies
- May require new revenue

**Political Durability**:

- Reforms vulnerable to future Congresses
- State implementation can undermine intent
- Narrative change needed for sustainability
- Coalition must be maintained

**Unintended Consequences**:

- Higher benefits might attract migration concerns
- Work requirement changes could affect labor supply
- State capacity varies to implement reforms
- Monitoring and enforcement capacity limited
