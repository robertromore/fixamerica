# Cash Assistance: History

## Origins

### Mothers' Pensions Era (1911-1935)

Before federal involvement, states created "mothers' pensions" to support widows with children:

- Illinois passed first state law in 1911
- By 1935, all but two states had programs
- Highly discretionary and racially exclusive
- "Suitable home" requirements excluded many families
- Limited funding reached small fraction of eligible families

### Aid to Dependent Children (1935-1962)

The Social Security Act of 1935 created the first federal cash assistance program:

- **ADC established** as matching grant to states
- Originally covered only children, not caregiving parent
- States retained control over eligibility and benefit levels
- Southern states explicitly designed to exclude Black families
- "Man in the house" rules denied benefits if man present

### Aid to Families with Dependent Children (1962-1996)

The program evolved significantly:

**1960s Expansions**:

- 1961: Coverage expanded to unemployed parents (AFDC-UP)
- 1962: Renamed AFDC, benefits extended to caregivers
- Supreme Court struck down "man in the house" rules
- Civil rights movement challenged racial exclusion
- Welfare rights movement expanded access

**1970s-1980s Backlash**:

- "Welfare queen" rhetoric emerged
- Ronald Reagan's 1976 campaign used coded racial appeals
- 1981 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act cut benefits
- Work requirements introduced
- Public opinion shifted against program

**Key Statistics Under AFDC**:

- 1970: 2.5 million families receiving aid
- 1994: 5 million families (peak)
- 1996: 4.4 million families
- AFDC-to-poverty ratio: 68% (1996)

## Key Turning Points

### The 1996 Welfare Reform

The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) fundamentally transformed cash assistance:

**Key Changes**:

| Feature | AFDC | TANF |
|---------|------|------|
| Legal Status | Entitlement | Block grant |
| Funding | Open-ended match | Fixed $16.5B |
| Time Limits | None | 60 months lifetime |
| Work Requirements | Limited | Mandatory |
| State Discretion | Moderate | Extensive |

**Political Context**:

- Bill Clinton's 1992 promise to "end welfare as we know it"
- Republican "Contract with America" (1994)
- Bipartisan support for work requirements
- Two earlier vetoes before Clinton signed
- Many Democrats opposed final bill

**Stated Goals**:

1. End dependence on government benefits
2. Promote work and marriage
3. Reduce out-of-wedlock births
4. Give states flexibility

### The Post-Reform Decline (1997-2007)

The decade following reform saw dramatic changes:

**Caseload Collapse**:

- 1996: 12.3 million recipients
- 2000: 5.8 million recipients
- 2007: 3.9 million recipients

**Causes of Decline**:

- Economic expansion (1996-2000)
- Work requirements pushed families off rolls
- Time limits exhausted benefits
- Sanctions for non-compliance
- Diversion at application
- Administrative barriers

**Employment Outcomes**:

- Initial employment gains for leavers
- Jobs largely low-wage, unstable
- Many families cycled back and forth
- By 2007, gains had largely dissipated

### The Great Recession Test (2008-2010)

TANF failed as an automatic stabilizer:

- Unemployment doubled (5% to 10%)
- Poverty increased by 15 million people
- TANF caseload increased only 13%
- SNAP (food stamps) increased 70%
- Block grant structure prevented expansion

**Key Lesson**: Fixed funding cannot respond to economic downturns.

### Continued Erosion (2010-Present)

Post-recession, the program continued shrinking:

- Caseloads fell even as poverty remained elevated
- TANF-to-poverty ratio dropped from 27% (2010) to 21% (2023)
- Real value of benefits continued declining
- States increasingly diverted funds from cash assistance

## Lessons from the Past

### What AFDC Got Right

- Entitlement structure ensured access during downturns
- Federal matching encouraged state investment
- Reforms expanded access over time
- Legal protections established due process rights

### What AFDC Got Wrong

- Racial exclusion built into design
- "Suitable home" provisions discriminatory
- Benefits never adequate in most states
- Stigma and moral judgments permeated program
- No pathway to economic advancement

### What 1996 Reform Got Wrong

- Block grant erodes over time without indexing
- Time limits arbitrary and harmful
- Work-first ignores barriers and skill development
- State flexibility enabled race to the bottom
- Eliminated entitlement status weakened safety net

### Unintended Consequences

The reform's effects include:

- Rise of deep poverty and "$2 per day" poverty
- Families with no cash income or TANF
- Increased child welfare involvement
- Homelessness among families
- Sanctions punishing the most vulnerable
