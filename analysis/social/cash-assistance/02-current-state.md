# Cash Assistance: Current State

## The Problem Today

### TANF's Collapse as a Safety Net

The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program has largely failed its core mission of providing cash assistance to poor families. Created in 1996 as the centerpiece of "welfare reform," TANF was designed to replace Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) with time-limited, work-focused assistance. Nearly three decades later, the program reaches a fraction of those in need while states redirect most funding to other purposes.

**The Coverage Crisis**:

- Only 21 of every 100 families in poverty receive TANF benefits
- In 1996, AFDC reached 68 of every 100 poor families
- Some states (Louisiana, Arkansas) have ratios below 5 per 100
- Caseloads have fallen from 12.3 million in 1996 to approximately 2 million

**Frozen Funding**:

- $16.5 billion block grant unchanged since 1997
- Adjusted for inflation, worth only $10 billion in 1996 dollars
- 40% real value loss means states have far fewer resources
- No mechanism for automatic adjustment to economic conditions

### Benefit Inadequacy

TANF benefits are too low to meet basic needs in any state:

| Category | Statistic |
|----------|-----------|
| Median maximum benefit (family of 3) | $492/month |
| States below 60% of poverty line | All 50 states |
| States below 30% of poverty line | 16 states |
| Lowest benefit (Mississippi) | $260/month |
| Highest benefit (New Hampshire) | $1,086/month |

Benefits have not kept pace with inflation. In real terms, the median state's maximum benefit is 40% lower than in 1996.

### Where TANF Money Actually Goes

States have broad discretion over TANF spending, and most direct funds away from cash assistance:

| Spending Category | Share of Total |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Basic Assistance (cash) | 24% |
| Work-Related Activities | 7% |
| Child Care | 16% |
| Refundable Tax Credits | 7% |
| Pre-K/Head Start | 7% |
| Child Welfare | 9% |
| Administration | 7% |
| Other/Unspecified | 23% |

The "other" category often includes:

- Marriage promotion programs
- Pregnancy prevention
- Transfer to state general funds
- Supplantation of state spending

## Key Statistics

### Program Reach

- **2 million recipients** nationwide
- **700,000 families** receiving assistance
- **Average family size**: 2.9 people
- **Child recipients**: ~1.5 million children

### Demographic Profile

- **Children**: 75% of recipients are children
- **Single parents**: Vast majority of adult recipients
- **Race**: 29% white, 29% Black, 36% Hispanic (disproportionate to poverty rates)
- **Education**: 60%+ lack high school diploma

### Work Requirements and Sanctions

- **Work participation rate requirement**: 50% of caseload
- **Required hours**: 30 hours/week (20 for single parents with young children)
- **Sanctioned annually**: 1 million+ cases
- **Full-family sanctions**: Most states remove entire family for non-compliance

### Time Limits

- **Federal limit**: 60 months lifetime
- **State limits**: 21 states impose shorter limits
- **Extensions**: Limited and difficult to obtain
- **Exemptions**: Vary widely by state

## Impact

### On Families in Deep Poverty

The erosion of TANF has contributed to the rise of "deep poverty" (income below 50% of poverty line):

- 18 million Americans in deep poverty
- 5.3 million children in deep poverty
- Families relying on SNAP and housing assistance without cash income
- Growth of "$2 per day" poverty in America

### On Child Well-Being

Children bear the brunt of TANF's failures:

- Material hardship (food insecurity, utility shutoffs, eviction)
- Developmental impacts from stress and instability
- School instability when families lose housing
- Health impacts from inadequate nutrition and medical care

### On Work and Economic Mobility

The work-first approach has produced mixed results:

- Initial employment gains largely eroded
- Jobs obtained are often unstable and low-wage
- Limited investment in education and training
- Cycling between work and welfare without advancement

### Racial Disparities

Research documents significant racial disparities in TANF administration:

- Black applicants more likely to be sanctioned
- Black families receive lower benefits in many states
- States with larger Black populations have stricter policies
- Caseworker discretion produces disparate outcomes

## Recent Developments

### COVID-19 Response

The pandemic exposed TANF's limitations:

- Caseloads barely increased despite mass unemployment
- Families turned to other programs (stimulus payments, expanded UI)
- Emergency funds allocated but largely unused for cash assistance
- Demonstrated need for automatic stabilizers

### State Policy Changes

Some states have begun reforms:

- Benefit increases in California, New York, New Jersey
- Time limit extensions or eliminations
- Reduced work requirements
- Expanded emergency assistance

### Federal Attention

Growing recognition of TANF's failures:

- Congressional hearings on TANF reauthorization
- Biden administration guidance on spending
- Proposals to index block grant to inflation
- Discussion of converting to matching grant
