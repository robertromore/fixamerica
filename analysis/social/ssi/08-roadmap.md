### Sequencing Rationale

**Why Asset Limits First**:

1. Builds bipartisan coalition (ABLE Act precedent)
2. Moderate cost relative to benefit increases
3. Immediately improves recipient welfare
4. Administrative simplification

**Why Benefits Later**:

1. Higher cost requires political momentum
2. Asset reform demonstrates commitment
3. Administrative capacity needs building
4. Coalition building takes time

## Political Strategy

### Coalition Building

**Phase 1 Allies**:

| Group | Appeal |
|-------|--------|
| Disability organizations | Core constituency |
| Poverty advocates | Anti-poverty mission |
| ABLE advocates | Build on success |
| Moderate Republicans | Administrative efficiency |

**Phase 2 Expansion**:

| Group | Appeal |
|-------|--------|
| Religious communities | Moral imperative |
| Business groups | Workforce development |
| Healthcare advocates | Medicaid connection |
| State governments | Reduced burden |

**Phase 3 Broad Coalition**:

- General public awareness
- Electoral constituency
- Institutional support
- Media allies

### Messaging Strategy

**Phase 1 Messaging**:

- "Updating rules frozen since 1989"
- "Allowing recipients to save for emergencies"
- "Common-sense modernization"
- "Administrative efficiency"

**Phase 2 Messaging**:

- "Ensuring dignity for disabled and elderly Americans"
- "Strengthening work incentives"
- "Supporting families"
- "Reducing poverty"

**Phase 3 Messaging**:

- "No American should live in poverty due to disability"
- "Modern safety net for modern economy"
- "Investing in our most vulnerable"

### Opposition Management

**Anticipated Opposition**:

| Phase | Opposition | Response |
|-------|------------|----------|
| 1 | Cost concerns | Modest investment, administrative savings |
| 2 | Expansion fears | Evidence-based, bipartisan |
| 3 | Ideological | Moral framing, constituency pressure |

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks

|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Political opposition | High | High | Coalition building, bipartisan framing |

### Contingency Plans

**If Full Reform Blocked**:
