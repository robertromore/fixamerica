# Supplemental Security Income (SSI): Overview

## Executive Summary

Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is the federal government's primary cash assistance program for aged, blind, and disabled Americans living in poverty. Established in 1972, SSI provides means-tested monthly benefits to approximately 7.5 million recipients, including 1.1 million children. Unlike Social Security (which is based on work history), SSI serves those who have never worked or whose work history is insufficient to qualify for Social Security benefits.

Despite its crucial role in preventing destitution, SSI is fundamentally broken. Asset limits have been frozen at $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples since 1989, trapping recipients in poverty and preventing even modest savings. Benefit levels fall below the poverty line in most states. Administrative backlogs mean applicants wait an average of 7 months for initial decisions, with over 10,000 people dying annually while waiting. The program's complex rules punish marriage, discourage work, and create administrative nightmares for recipients trying to navigate byzantine regulations.

## Scope

### What This Subtopic Covers

- **Program basics**: Eligibility, benefit levels, asset and income rules
- **Recipient demographics**: Aged, blind, disabled adults, and children
- **Disability determination**: Initial applications, appeals, CDRs
- **SSI vs. SSDI**: Key differences between means-tested and earned benefits
- **Work incentives**: PASS, IRWE, Section 1619(b)
- **Administrative issues**: Backlogs, overpayments, representative payees
- **Marriage penalty**: How marriage reduces benefits
- **State supplements**: State contributions above federal benefit

### What This Subtopic Does Not Cover

- Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) in detail (see [Disability Domain](../../disability/01-overview.md))
- Medicare/Medicaid policy generally (see [Healthcare](../../healthcare/01-overview.md))
- Veterans disability benefits (see [Veterans](../../veterans/01-overview.md))
- Workers' compensation (see [Labor](../../labor/01-overview.md))

## Key Questions

1. **Why do asset limits trap people in poverty?** Why haven't limits been updated since 1989, and what is the impact?

2. **Why do so many people die waiting?** What causes processing delays, and how can they be reduced?

3. **Why does marriage reduce benefits?** How do deeming rules create a marriage penalty, and what are alternatives?

4. **How does SSI interact with work?** What incentives and disincentives exist, and do they achieve policy goals?

5. **What explains the children's SSI controversy?** Why was SSI for children targeted for cuts, and what is the evidence?

## Why This Matters

**Poverty Prevention**: SSI keeps 3 million people above the poverty line annually

**Last Resort**: For many disabled and elderly poor, SSI is the only income source

**Children's Wellbeing**: 1.1 million children with severe disabilities rely on SSI

**Systemic Failure**: Administrative dysfunction results in preventable deaths

**Economic Security**: Asset limits prevent recipients from building any financial stability

**Dignity**: Current rules treat recipients as suspects rather than citizens

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Total recipients | 7.5 million |
| Aged recipients (65+) | 1.1 million |
| Blind/disabled adults | 5.3 million |
| Blind/disabled children | 1.1 million |
| Federal benefit rate (individual) | $943/month (2024) |
| Federal benefit rate (couple) | $1,415/month (2024) |
| Asset limit (individual) | $2,000 |

## The Problem in Context

### Asset Limits: Frozen in Time

| Year | Asset Limit | Inflation-Adjusted (2024) |
|------|------------|---------------------------|
| 1972 (SSI created) | $1,500 | ~$11,000 |
| 1989 (last increase) | $2,000 | ~$5,200 |
| 2024 | $2,000 | $2,000 |

**Impact**: Recipients cannot save for emergencies, purchase a reliable vehicle, or accumulate any buffer against financial shocks.

### Benefits Below Poverty Line

| Standard | Monthly Amount |
|----------|----------------|
| SSI Federal Benefit Rate (individual) | $943 |
| 2024 Federal Poverty Line (individual) | $1,255/month |
| Gap | $312/month (25% below poverty) |

### Processing Delays

| Stage | Average Wait |
|-------|--------------|
| Initial application | 7 months |
| First appeal (reconsideration) | 5 months |
| Second appeal (ALJ hearing) | 12-18 months |
| Total if appealed | 2-3 years |
