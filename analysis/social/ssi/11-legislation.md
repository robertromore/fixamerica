# Supplemental Security Income (SSI): Legislation

## Overview

SSI reform requires primarily federal legislation, as SSI is a federal program administered by the Social Security Administration. Key legislative priorities include updating asset limits, increasing benefit levels, eliminating the marriage penalty, and improving administrative processes. This document provides model legislation for comprehensive SSI reform.

## Federal Legislation

### SSI Restoration Act

**Purpose**: Comprehensively modernize SSI by updating asset limits, benefit levels, income rules, and eliminating the marriage penalty.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "SSI Restoration Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that:
(1) Supplemental Security Income (SSI) provides essential support
to 7.5 million aged, blind, and disabled Americans living in
poverty.
(2) SSI asset limits have been frozen at $2,000 for individuals
and $3,000 for couples since 1989, losing more than 60 percent
of their real value to inflation.
(3) Current asset limits trap recipients in poverty by
preventing even modest savings for emergencies.
(4) SSI benefits of $943 per month for individuals are 25
percent below the federal poverty line.
(5) The SSI marriage penalty reduces combined benefits by
25 percent when two SSI recipients marry.
(6) Income exclusions have not been updated since 1972.
(7) These outdated rules perpetuate poverty and deny dignity
to the most vulnerable Americans.

```

**Explanation**:

- Section 3: Increases asset limits to $10,000/$20,000 and indexes to inflation
- Section 4: Excludes all retirement accounts, vehicles, and emergency savings
- Section 5: Eliminates marriage penalty by setting couple rate at 200% of individual
- Section 6: Updates income exclusions and indexes to inflation
- Section 7: Reduces benefit reduction rate from 50% to 33%
- Section 8: Reforms deeming rules for spouses and parents
- Section 9: Phases in benefit increase to poverty level over 4 years

**Potential Challenges**:

## Regulatory Framework

### SSA Rulemaking Authority

**Existing Authority**:

- Commissioner has authority to issue regulations implementing SSI
- 20 C.F.R. Part 416 contains SSI regulations
- Can clarify rules within statutory parameters
- Cannot exceed statutory asset limits or benefit levels

### Proposed Regulatory Improvements

**Work Incentive Clarifications**:

```text
PROPOSED RULE: WORK INCENTIVE SIMPLIFICATION

The Commissioner proposes to amend 20 C.F.R. Part 416 to:

1. Simplify PASS plan application and approval process;
2. Create presumptive categories for IRWE deductions;
3. Clarify Section 1619(b) continuation requirements;
4. Establish automatic enrollment in work incentives
   where appropriate.

Comment period: 60 days
```

**Overpayment Reform**:

```text
PROPOSED RULE: OVERPAYMENT WAIVER STANDARDS

The Commissioner proposes to amend 20 C.F.R. § 416.550 to:

1. Presume waiver appropriate when overpayment caused
   by agency error;
2. Limit recovery to 5 percent of monthly benefit;
3. Expand "without fault" standard;
4. Establish 3-year statute of limitations on collection.

Comment period: 60 days
```

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

**Congressional Power**:

- Spending Clause: Full authority to set SSI terms
- No constitutional barrier to asset limit or benefit changes
- Marriage penalty elimination clearly permissible

**No Constitutional Constraints**:

- SSI is statutory program, not constitutional right
- Congress may expand or contract benefits
- No state sovereignty issues (federal program)

### Implementation Issues

**SSA Capacity**:

- Major changes require system updates
- Staff training needed
- Implementation timeline realistic
- Phased approach reduces strain

**State Coordination**:

- State supplements must be recalculated
- Medicaid eligibility unchanged (linked to SSI)
- 209(b) states may need adjustments
- State DDS agencies affected by processing reforms

### Enforcement

**Administrative Enforcement**:

- SSA implements all changes
- No private right of action needed
- Existing administrative appeals apply
- OIG oversight continues

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Asset timing manipulation | Transfer assets before application/review | Low |
| Retirement account use | Withdraw from excluded accounts for current consumption | Low |
| Marriage timing | Game timing of marriage for benefit purposes | Low |
| Income timing | Defer income to avoid reduction | Low |
| Multiple vehicle ownership | Accumulate vehicles as assets | Low |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Benefit still below poverty (during phase-in) | Continued hardship | Fiscal constraints |
| State supplements vary | Geographic inequality | Federalism |
| Processing delays may persist | Continued waiting | Implementation lag |
| Work disincentives remain | Fear of work | Benefit cliffs |
| Medicaid dependence continues | Healthcare trap | Separate program |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Asset Timing**: The 36-month lookback period for asset transfers prevents gaming; maintain existing anti-fraud provisions while implementing higher limits.

2. **Retirement Account Use**: Retirement accounts excluded regardless of withdrawals; withdrawals become income and are counted under income rules, maintaining program integrity.

3. **Marriage Timing**: With marriage penalty eliminated, no incentive to game marriage timing; monitor for any unexpected patterns.

4. **Income Timing**: Existing income rules average income over applicable periods; no significant gaming opportunity.

5. **Vehicle Accumulation**: Vehicles excluded but remain assets; unusual accumulation could be addressed through specific anti-abuse provisions if needed.

6. **Benefit Adequacy During Phase-In**: Accelerate phase-in if fiscal conditions permit; states encouraged to increase supplements during federal phase-in.

7. **State Supplement Variation**: Consider federal matching funds to incentivize state supplements; ultimately, consider federalizing supplements entirely.

8. **Processing Delays**: Funding increases and staffing requirements should be mandatory, not discretionary; Congress should appropriate required amounts.

9. **Work Disincentives**: Additional legislation may be needed to eliminate benefit cliff entirely; consider healthcare decoupling through broader health reform.

10. **Medicaid Dependence**: Ultimate solution is universal healthcare; interim, strengthen Section 1619(b) and Medicaid buy-in programs.

### General Implementation Concerns

**Funding Sustainability**:

- SSI costs are mandatory spending
- Reforms increase baseline costs
- Long-term fiscal sustainability requires dedicated funding
- Consider dedicated revenue source

**Administrative Capacity**:

- SSA must receive adequate appropriations
- Technology modernization takes time
- Staff training essential
- Realistic implementation timelines needed

**Coordination Requirements**:

- Federal-state coordination essential
- SSA-DDS coordination
- Medicaid program coordination
- Benefits counselor capacity

**Monitoring and Adjustment**:

- Regular reporting to Congress
- GAO evaluation of implementation
- Adjustment authority for unintended consequences
- Sunset/reauthorization provisions for accountability
