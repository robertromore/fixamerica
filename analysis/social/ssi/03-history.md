# Supplemental Security Income (SSI): History

## Pre-SSI Era (Before 1972)

### State-Administered Programs

Before SSI, assistance for the aged, blind, and disabled came through three separate federal-state programs:

| Program | Established | Administration |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Old Age Assistance (OAA) | 1935 | State-federal |
| Aid to the Blind (AB) | 1935 | State-federal |
| Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled (APTD) | 1950 | State-federal |

### Problems with Pre-SSI Programs

**Inadequate Benefits**:

- Benefit levels varied enormously by state
- Southern states provided minimal assistance
- No national floor on benefits

**Inconsistent Eligibility**:

- Each state set its own eligibility criteria
- Residency requirements excluded migrants
- Discriminatory administration common

**Administrative Complexity**:

- Three separate programs with different rules
- State-by-state variation created confusion
- Federal oversight limited

**Racial Discrimination**:

- "Suitable home" provisions used to exclude Black families
- "Man in the house" rules disproportionately enforced
- Local discretion enabled discrimination

## Creation of SSI (1972)

### Nixon Administration Initiative

President Nixon proposed SSI as part of broader welfare reform:

**Goals**:

- Establish national minimum benefit
- Federalize administration
- Simplify three programs into one
- Provide uniform eligibility standards

### Social Security Amendments of 1972

**Key Provisions**:

- Created SSI as Title XVI of Social Security Act
- Established federal benefit floor
- Set initial asset limits at $1,500 individual, $2,250 couple
- Required states to supplement federal benefit (hold-harmless)
- Transferred administration to SSA

**Congressional Action**:

- Passed with bipartisan support
- Part of package including 20% Social Security increase
- Automatic cost-of-living adjustments added

### Implementation (1974)

SSI began January 1, 1974:

| Metric | At Implementation |
|--------|-------------------|
| Initial benefit (individual) | $140/month |
| Initial benefit (couple) | $210/month |
| Asset limit (individual) | $1,500 |
| Asset limit (couple) | $2,250 |
| Initial recipients | 3.2 million |
| States with supplements | All (mandatory) |

**Implementation Challenges**:

- SSA unfamiliar with means-tested programs
- Computer systems inadequate
- Converting state recipients to federal program complex
- Many eligible individuals not enrolled

## Early Program Development (1974-1984)

### Expansion of Coverage

**1976**: Asset limits raised to $1,500/$2,250

**1980**: Disability evaluation reformed

- Sequential evaluation process established
- Standardized disability determination

**1983**: Asset limits raised to $1,600/$2,400

### Disability Review Crisis (1980-1984)

**Background**:

- Carter administration began Continuing Disability Reviews (CDRs)
- Reagan administration accelerated reviews
- Goal: Remove recipients who had "improved"

**Impact**:

- 1.2 million cases reviewed in 3 years
- 490,000 benefits terminated
- Mass appeals overwhelmed system
- Media coverage of suicides and deaths

**Congressional Response**:

- Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984
- Required medical improvement standard
- Face-to-face evidentiary hearings
- Moratorium on mental impairment reviews

## Asset Limit Freeze (1984-Present)

### 1984 Increase

- Individual limit raised to $1,800
- Couple limit raised to $2,700

### 1989 Increase (Last Update)

- Individual limit raised to $2,000
- Couple limit raised to $3,000
- **No increase since**

### Inflation Impact

| Year | Asset Limit | Inflation-Adjusted Value (2024$) |
|------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| 1972 | $1,500 | ~$11,000 |
| 1984 | $1,800 | ~$5,300 |
| 1989 | $2,000 | ~$5,200 |
| 2024 | $2,000 | $2,000 |

## Welfare Reform Era (1996)

### Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act

**SSI Provisions**:

- Eliminated SSI for most non-citizens
- Restricted eligibility for drug addiction/alcoholism
- Required CDRs at least every 3 years for children
- Tightened childhood disability standard

**Non-Citizen Restrictions**:

- Legal permanent residents lost eligibility unless:
    - 40 quarters of work history, or
    - Veteran/military connection, or
    - Refugee/asylee (time-limited)

**Impact**:

- 500,000+ non-citizens lost benefits
- States created substitute programs for some
- Immigrant communities devastated

### Childhood SSI Changes

**New Standard**:

- Replaced "comparable severity" with "marked and severe functional limitations"
- Required individualized functional assessments
- Eliminated Individual Functional Assessments (IFAs) initially

**Zebley Implementation** (Pre-1996):

- *Sullivan v. Zebley* (1990) had expanded childhood eligibility
- Allowed IFAs for children not meeting Listings
- Program grew from 265,000 to 955,000 children (1989-1996)

**Post-1996 Results**:

- 135,000 children lost benefits in reviews
- Significant controversy over terminations
- Many reinstatements on appeal

## 2000s: Administrative Challenges

### Processing Backlog Growth

| Year | Pending Cases | Average Wait (ALJ) |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| 2000 | 311,000 | 9 months |
| 2007 | 750,000 | 18 months |
| 2008 | 760,000 | 20 months |

### Backlog Reduction Efforts

**Compassionate Allowances** (2008):

- Fast-track for certain severe conditions
- Over 200 conditions now included
- Average processing: weeks vs. months

**Quick Disability Determinations** (2007):

- Predictive model identifies clear allowances
- Faster processing for obvious cases

### SSA Funding Constraints

- Budget did not keep pace with workload
- Field office closures
- Staffing reductions
- Technology investments delayed

## 2010s: Continued Struggles

### Processing Improvements and Backlog

| Year | Pending Hearings | Average Wait |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| 2010 | 700,000 | 14 months |
| 2015 | 1,000,000+ | 18 months |
| 2019 | 570,000 | 17 months |

### Fraud Prevention Controversies

**CDR Controversies**:

- Media stories questioning disability legitimacy
- Congressional hearings on "disability fraud"
- Evidence showed actual fraud rate very low (<1%)

**ALJ Scrutiny**:

- Some judges had very high allowance rates
- Policy changes to increase uniformity
- Concerns about independence of judges

### Work Incentive Developments

**ABLE Accounts** (2014):

- Achieving a Better Life Experience Act
- Tax-advantaged savings for disabled individuals
- Does not count against SSI asset limit (up to $100,000)
- First asset-related modernization in decades

## Recent Developments (2020-Present)

### COVID-19 Pandemic Response

**Temporary Measures**:

- SSA office closures
- Telephone hearings expanded
- Flexibilities in documentation requirements
- No economic impact payment for SSI (initially)

**Processing Impact**:

- Initial application backlogs grew
- CDRs suspended temporarily
- Gradual resumption of normal operations

### Benefit Updates

| Year | Individual Benefit | COLA |
|------|-------------------|------|
| 2020 | $783 | 1.6% |
| 2021 | $794 | 1.3% |
| 2022 | $841 | 5.9% |
| 2023 | $914 | 8.7% |
| 2024 | $943 | 3.2% |

### Legislative Proposals

**SSI Restoration Act** (Various Congresses):

- Update asset limits to $10,000/$20,000
- Eliminate marriage penalty
- Update income exclusions
- Has not passed despite repeated introduction

**Bipartisan Support Building**:

- Growing recognition of asset limit problem
- ABLE accounts demonstrated bipartisan appetite
- COVID exposed fragility of safety net

## Historical Themes

### Consistent Patterns

**Funding Inadequacy**:

- SSA consistently underfunded relative to workload
- Processing times remain problematic
- Customer service degraded

**Asset Limits Frozen**:

- Political difficulty of increasing
- Fear of "expanding welfare"
- Recipients bear cost of inaction

**Periodic Crackdowns**:

- Cycles of "fraud" concern
- Reviews often harm legitimate recipients
- Little evidence of widespread fraud

**Incremental Improvements**:

- Work incentives added piecemeal
- ABLE accounts represented rare victory
- Comprehensive reform elusive

### Key Legislative Milestones

| 1972 | Social Security Amendments | Created SSI |
| 1984 | Disability Benefits Reform Act | Protected against wrongful terminations |
| 1989 | Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act | Last asset limit increase |
