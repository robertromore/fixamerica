# Supplemental Security Income (SSI): Solutions

## Overview

SSI reform requires addressing multiple interconnected problems: frozen asset limits, inadequate benefits, the marriage penalty, administrative dysfunction, and work disincentive structures. Solutions range from incremental improvements achievable through regulation to comprehensive legislative reform.

## Asset Limit Reform

### Update Asset Limits

**Current Problem**: Limits frozen at $2,000/$3,000 since 1989

**Proposed Solution**: Increase to $10,000 individual, $20,000 couple

**Rationale**:

| Metric | Current | Proposed | Inflation-Adjusted 1989 |
|--------|---------|----------|-------------------------|
| Individual | $2,000 | $10,000 | $5,200 |
| Couple | $3,000 | $20,000 | $7,800 |

**Implementation**:

- Immediate increase to $10,000/$20,000
- Annual inflation indexing thereafter
- Exclude retirement accounts entirely
- Exclude all vehicles

**Expected Impact**:

| Outcome | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Financial security | Recipients can save for emergencies |
| Reduced administration | Less asset monitoring needed |
| Dignity | Treat recipients as adults |
| Work incentive | Can save earnings without penalty |

### Eliminate Asset Test Entirely

**Radical Alternative**: Remove asset limits completely

**Rationale**:

- Income test already ensures need
- Asset monitoring costly and intrusive
- Savings do not indicate lack of need
- Simplifies administration

**Considerations**:

- Higher cost (more people eligible)
- More consistent with social insurance approach
- Eliminates poverty trap
- Administrative savings offset some cost

### Expand Excluded Assets

**Intermediate Reform**: Broaden asset exclusions

| Asset Type | Current | Proposed |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Primary residence | Excluded | Excluded |
| Vehicles | One (limited) | All |
| Retirement accounts | ABLE only | All IRAs, 401(k)s |
| Emergency savings | None | $5,000 |
| Burial funds | $1,500 | Unlimited |

## Benefit Level Reform

### Increase Federal Benefit Rate

**Current Problem**: Benefits ($943/month) are 25% below poverty line

**Proposed Solutions**:

| Option | Benefit Level | Cost Increase |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Poverty line | $1,255/month | ~30% |
| 125% of poverty | $1,569/month | ~65% |
| Match SSDI average | $1,537/month | ~60% |

**Implementation**:

- Immediate increase to poverty level
- Phase in higher level over 3-5 years
- Maintain COLA indexing
- Consider indexing to poverty line rather than CPI

### Index Benefits to Appropriate Measure

**Options**:

| Index | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| CPI-W (current) | Maintains purchasing power |
| CPI-E (elderly) | Better reflects senior expenses |
| Poverty line | Maintains relationship to need |
| Median wage | Share of prosperity |

## Marriage Penalty Elimination

### Current Problem

| Status | Monthly Benefit |
|--------|-----------------|
| Two individuals | $1,886 |
| Married couple | $1,415 |
| Loss from marriage | $471/month |

### Proposed Solutions

**Option 1: Double Individual Rate for Couples**

- Couple rate = 2 x individual rate ($1,886)
- Eliminates penalty entirely
- Cost: ~$2 billion/year additional

**Option 2: Proportional Increase**

- Couple rate = 175% of individual rate (~$1,650)
- Reduces but does not eliminate penalty
- Lower cost than full elimination

**Option 3: Disregard Spouse Status**

- Treat each person as individual
- Eliminate deeming of spouse income
- Most comprehensive but highest cost

### Rationale

- Marriage should not be penalized
- Current rule arbitrary and harmful
- Encourages relationship fraud
- Violates family values conservatives claim to support

## Income Rules Reform

### Update Income Exclusions

**Current Problem**: Exclusions frozen since program inception

**Proposed Updates**:

| Exclusion | Current | Proposed |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| General income | $20/month | $100/month |
| Earned income | $65/month | $400/month |
| Student earned income | $2,290/month | $3,000/month |

**Indexing**: All exclusions indexed to inflation

### Reform Deeming Rules

**Parental Deeming**:

- Raise deeming threshold
- Phase out rather than cliff
- Exclude parent disability expenses
- End deeming at 18 regardless of living situation

**Spousal Deeming**:

- Raise exclusion amounts
- Phase out gradually
- Consider eliminating for elderly couples
- Account for actual income sharing

### Reduce Benefit Reduction Rate

**Current**: After exclusions, benefits reduced $1 for every $2 earned

**Proposed**: Reduce to $1 for every $3 earned

**Effect**: Working recipients keep more earnings, strengthening work incentive

## Work Incentive Improvements

### Strengthen Section 1619

**Section 1619(a) Enhancement**:

- Raise SGA threshold
- Clarify eligibility rules
- Automatic enrollment
- Better outreach

**Section 1619(b) Enhancement**:

- Raise income threshold significantly
- Simplify qualification
- Automatic continuation
- Reduce fear of Medicaid loss

### PASS Plan Reform

**Current Problems**:

- Complex application
- Long approval times
- Limited awareness
- Only ~5,000 active plans

**Proposed Reforms**:

| Reform | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Simplify application | More people use PASS |
| Faster approval | 30-day target |
| Outreach campaign | Awareness increase |
| Training for SSA staff | Better assistance |

### IRWE Improvements

**Current Problems**:

- Documentation burdensome
- Limited awareness
- Narrow interpretation

**Proposed Reforms**:

- Simplified documentation
- Presumptive categories
- Higher limits
- Better outreach

### Benefit Cliff Elimination

**Problem**: Losing Medicaid can cost more than wages gained

**Solutions**:

| Solution | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| Extended Medicaid | 5-year coverage after SSI ends |
| Buy-in programs | Affordable Medicaid for workers |
| Gradual phase-out | Benefits decline slowly |
| Healthcare decoupling | Universal coverage solves problem |

## Administrative Reform

### SSA Funding Increase

**Problem**: Chronic underfunding causes delays

**Proposed**:

| Investment | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Staff increase (20%) | Reduce processing times |
| Technology modernization | Improve accuracy, speed |
| Field office expansion | Better access |
| Phone system upgrade | Shorter wait times |

**Cost-Benefit**: GAO finds $9 return for every $1 invested in program integrity

### Processing Time Reduction

**Targets**:

| Stage | Current | Target |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Initial application | 7 months | 3 months |
| Reconsideration | 5 months | 2 months |
| ALJ hearing | 12-18 months | 6 months |
| Total (if appeal) | 2-3 years | 1 year |

**Methods**:

- Hire more disability examiners
- Hire more ALJs

- Presumptive eligibility for severe conditions

### Compassionate Allowance Expansion

**Current**: ~200 conditions qualify

**Proposed**:

- Expand list significantly
- Add common severe conditions
- Reduce documentation for obvious cases
- Fast-track terminal illness

### Overpayment Reform

**Problems**:

- Recipients penalized for SSA errors
- Aggressive collection harms recipients
- Fear discourages work and reporting

**Solutions**:

| Reform | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Fault standard | Only collect if recipient at fault |
| Lower collection rate | 5% vs. 10% of benefit |
| Expanded waivers | More granted when not at fault |
| Statute of limitations | Cap on collection period |

## Disability Determination Reform

- Consider national elimination
- Direct to ALJ hearing
- Saves time, not money (same result)

**ALJ Hearing Improvement**:

- Hire more ALJs
- Video hearings expand access

### CDR Reform

**Balance Program Integrity and Recipient Protection**:

- Conduct CDRs on schedule (currently backlogged)
