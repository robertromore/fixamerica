# Safety Net Design: Overview

America's safety net is not a coordinated system but a patchwork of 80+ means-tested programs operating across multiple agencies with conflicting rules, different eligibility criteria, and incompatible administrative systems. This fragmentation creates severe consequences: effective marginal tax rates exceeding 100% at certain income levels, benefit cliffs that cost families $10,000+ for small wage increases, administrative churn that causes 12 million people to lose Medicaid annually, and bureaucratic burdens that consume 10-15% of program budgets. The average TANF recipient must navigate 3+ separate agencies, each with its own application, documentation requirements, and recertification schedules.
