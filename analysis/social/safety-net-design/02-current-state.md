# Safety Net Design: Current State

## System Overview

### The Federal Landscape

The U.S. operates approximately 80 means-tested programs across 20+ federal agencies, with significant state variation in implementation. Total means-tested spending exceeds $1 trillion annually, yet poverty rates remain higher than peer nations.

**Major Program Categories**:

| Category | Annual Spending | Recipients |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| Healthcare (Medicaid/CHIP) | ~$700 billion | 85 million |
| Cash/Tax Credits (EITC, CTC, SSI) | ~$200 billion | 50 million |
| Food (SNAP, WIC, School Meals) | ~$130 billion | 60 million |
| Housing | ~$50 billion | 5 million |
| Other (LIHEAP, childcare, etc.) | ~$50 billion | Varies |

### State-Level Variation

States have enormous discretion in administering federal programs:

**TANF Benefit Levels (Family of 3, 2024)**:

| Highest Benefits | Lowest Benefits |
|------------------|-----------------|
| New Hampshire: $1,098 | Mississippi: $260 |
| Vermont: $979 | Alabama: $268 |
| California: $950 | Louisiana: $284 |
| New York: $903 | Texas: $308 |
| Massachusetts: $878 | Arkansas: $310 |

**SNAP Administration Quality** (error rates, processing times):

| Best Performers | Worst Performers |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Massachusetts | Alabama |
| Minnesota | Nevada |
| Vermont | California |
| Wisconsin | Florida |
| Rhode Island | Louisiana |

## The Benefit Cliff Reality

### Detailed Cliff Analysis

**Case Study: Philadelphia Single Mother, Two Children**

At specific income thresholds, small raises trigger catastrophic benefit losses:

| Income | SNAP | Medicaid | CHIP | Childcare | EITC | Housing | Net Position |
|--------|------|----------|------|-----------|------|---------|--------------|
| $20,000 | $6,000 | Full | Full | $8,000 | $5,800 | $7,200 | $47,000 |
| $25,000 | $4,500 | Full | Full | $5,000 | $5,200 | $6,000 | $45,700 |
| $30,000 | $3,000 | Lost | Full | $2,000 | $4,000 | $4,800 | $43,800 |
| $35,000 | $1,500 | Lost | Lost | $0 | $2,500 | $3,600 | $42,600 |
| $40,000 | $0 | Lost | Lost | $0 | $1,000 | $2,400 | $43,400 |
| $45,000 | $0 | Lost | Lost | $0 | $0 | $0 | $45,000 |

**Key Cliffs Identified**:

1. **Medicaid cliff** (~138% FPL): Losing Medicaid for marketplace coverage can cost $5,000+ annually
2. **Childcare cliff** (varies): Full subsidy loss can equal $10,000+
3. **Housing cliff** (varies): Loss of Section 8 can equal $8,000+
4. **SNAP cliff** (130% FPL gross): Immediate benefit reduction

### Geographic Variation in Cliffs

**States with Severe Cliffs**:
- Pennsylvania: Childcare subsidy cliff at 200% FPL
- Florida: No Medicaid expansion creates coverage gap
- Texas: Multiple program cliffs cluster around $30,000

**States with Smoother Transitions**:
- Vermont: Extended Medicaid, integrated services
- Minnesota: Graduated childcare subsidies
- Oregon: Transitional benefits programs

## Asset Limits Analysis

### Current Asset Tests
