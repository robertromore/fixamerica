# Safety Net Design: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Reforming America's fragmented safety net requires comprehensive legislative action to eliminate benefit cliffs, reduce administrative burden, integrate programs, and ensure adequate support. This document provides model legislation at federal and state levels, including the Safety Net Integration Act, Benefit Cliff Elimination Act, Administrative Burden Reduction Act, and Universal Basic Income Pilot Act.

## Federal Legislation

### Safety Net Integration Act

    agencies to receive benefits.
(3) Fragmented administration creates duplicative documentation
    requirements, conflicting eligibility rules, and unnecessary
    complexity.
(4) Administrative costs consume 10-15 percent of program budgets.
(5) Approximately 12 million people lose Medicaid annually due to
    administrative issues rather than changed circumstances.
(6) Program fragmentation creates benefit cliffs where effective
    marginal tax rates can exceed 100 percent.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Benefit Cliff Elimination Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Benefit cliffs occur when small increases in earnings cause
    disproportionate losses in public benefits.
(2) At certain income levels, effective marginal tax rates can
    exceed 100 percent, meaning families lose more than they gain
    from additional work.
(3) Benefit cliffs trap families in poverty by penalizing work
    and career advancement.
(4) A single parent earning $25,000 who receives a $5,000 raise
    can lose $10,000 or more in combined benefits.
(5) Coordinating program phase-outs can eliminate cliffs while
    maintaining work incentives.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

(a) EFFECTIVE MARGINAL TAX RATE.—The term "effective marginal tax
    rate" means the percentage of each additional dollar of earnings
    lost to federal and state taxes plus benefit phase-outs.

(b) COORDINATION.—The Interagency Coordination Council established
    under the Safety Net Integration Act shall coordinate program
    phase-outs to achieve the cap in subsection (a).

(c) PHASE-OUT RATE LIMITS.—No covered program shall have a benefit
    phase-out rate exceeding 30 percent when combined with other
    programs' phase-out rates at the same income level.

    (1) The tenant contribution shall increase gradually beyond
        30 percent of income rather than terminating at
        eligibility thresholds.
    (2) Families exceeding income limits shall receive 24 months
        of transition assistance.
    (3) HUD shall develop portable vouchers usable across
        jurisdictions.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Safety Net Integration Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Definition gaming | Agencies may define income/household narrowly to limit coordination | Medium |
| Data sharing resistance | Agencies may cite privacy or technical barriers | High |
| Waiver abuse | States may seek waivers undermining integration | Medium |
| Implementation delay | Four-year timeline allows indefinite delay | Medium |
| Funding dependence | Requires appropriations that may not materialize | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Voluntary coordination | Council has coordination but not command authority | Separation of powers |
| Program-specific statutes | Each program has distinct legal framework | Legislative history |
| State variation | 50 different implementations remain | Federalism |
| Technical complexity | IT integration genuinely difficult | Legacy systems |
| Political vulnerability | Next administration may reverse | Executive nature of council |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Definition gaming**: Require OMB review of definitions; public comment on changes; annual certification of compliance
2. **Data sharing resistance**: Specific statutory authorization; funding penalties for non-sharing; independent technical review of claimed barriers
3. **Waiver abuse**: Limit waiver authority; require public notice and comment; sunset provisions on waivers
4. **Implementation delay**: Interim milestones with funding consequences; Congressional reporting; GAO monitoring
5. **Funding dependence**: Mandatory appropriations where possible; multi-year authorizations; dedicated trust fund consideration
6. **Political durability**: Statutory rather than executive establishment of council; bipartisan membership requirements; performance metrics that create constituency

### Benefit Cliff Elimination Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| EMTR calculation gaming | Agencies may calculate EMTR favorably | Medium |
| Phase-out stacking | New programs may add phase-outs | Medium |
| State non-compliance | States may resist coordination | Medium |
| Transition gaps | Families may fall through during transition | High |
| Employer gaming | Employers may manipulate wages to benefit from cliffs | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Only covers listed programs | New programs may create cliffs | Enumeration limits |
| State programs excluded | State-only programs may create cliffs | Federalism |
| Dynamic effects | Behavior changes may alter cliff locations | Economic complexity |
| Cost of smoothing | Extended phase-outs cost more | Budget math |
| Program integrity | Longer phase-outs extend eligibility | Targeting tradeoff |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **EMTR calculation**: Independent verification by CBO; standardized methodology; public calculator
2. **Phase-out stacking**: Require cliff analysis for any new program; automatic EMTR cap applies to all means-tested programs
3. **State non-compliance**: Condition federal funding on cliff reduction; technical assistance; positive incentives
4. **Transition gaps**: Hold-harmless provisions during transition; bridge benefits; automatic enrollment in replacement coverage
5. **New programs**: Prospective EMTR requirement for any new means-tested program; integrated design mandate
6. **Cost concerns**: Document long-term savings from better work incentives; reduced churn costs

### Administrative Burden Reduction Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Verification exceptions | Agencies may create broad exceptions to self-attestation | High |
| Interview workarounds | Agencies may require "voluntary" interviews | Medium |
| Technology barriers | Online systems may be inaccessible in practice | Medium |
| Documentation creep | New requirements may emerge over time | Medium |
| State implementation | States may add requirements beyond federal minimums | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Fraud concerns | Simplified verification may increase improper payments | Program integrity goals |
| Technical capacity | Many states lack IT capacity for electronic verification | State variation |
| Staff resistance | Caseworkers may resist procedural changes | Institutional culture |
| Non-filer exclusion | Tax-based verification misses non-filers | System design |
| Language barriers | Translation takes time and resources | Resource constraints |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Verification exceptions**: Narrow exception authority; require public justification; OMB approval for exceptions
2. **Interview workarounds**: Prohibit requiring interviews under different names; monitor interview rates; recipient complaint mechanism
3. **Technology barriers**: Accessibility testing requirements; funding for state IT; alternative access pathways maintained
4. **Documentation creep**: Annual burden inventory; sunset for any new requirement; OMB review
5. **State additions**: Federal floor preemption where appropriate; funding conditions
6. **Fraud balance**: Risk-based verification; post-enrollment audits; improper payment targets that don't incentivize over-verification

### Universal Basic Income Pilot Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Cherry-picking sites | Pilots may be located to show desired results | Medium |
| Short duration | Three years may be insufficient for long-term effects | Medium |
| Benefit interaction manipulation | Waivers may create unrealistic policy environment | Medium |
| Political interference | Administration may shape findings | High |
| Insufficient scale | Small pilots may lack statistical power | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Cost uncertainty | Full-scale cost hard to estimate from pilots | Pilot limitations |
| Labor supply concerns | Pilots may not capture equilibrium effects | Partial equilibrium |
| Sustainability questions | Pilots temporary; permanent program different | Design constraint |
| Generalizability | Pilot sites may not be representative | Site selection |
| Political sustainability | Pilots may end before completion | Political cycles |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Site selection**: Independent scientific advisory board for site selection; diversity requirements; pre-registration of site selection criteria
2. **Duration**: Minimum three years statutory; option to extend; long-term follow-up required
3. **Benefit interaction**: Test realistic integration scenarios; document waiver effects separately; simulate full implementation
4. **Political interference**: Independent evaluation contractors; pre-registered analysis plans; data made public; Congressional reporting requirements
5. **Scale**: Minimum enrollment requirements; statistical power analysis required; multi-site design
6. **Long-term effects**: Follow-up requirements; data collection beyond pilot period; funding for long-term evaluation

### Cross-Cutting Issues
