# Safety Net Design: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Framework

### Change Theory

Comprehensive safety net reform requires building from achievable wins toward transformative change:

1. **Demonstrate feasibility** through state pilots and limited federal action
2. **Build evidence base** showing benefits of integration
3. **Create political momentum** through coalition building
4. **Lock in gains** through legislation and administrative action
5. **Scale successes** to comprehensive reform

### Political Windows

Reform opportunities arise during:
- Economic recessions (counter-cyclical need)
- New administrations (first 100 days)
- Program reauthorizations (Farm Bill, TANF)
- State-level innovation (demonstration effects)
- Crisis moments (pandemic, disaster response)

### Coalition Requirements

Sustainable reform requires:
- Anti-poverty advocates
- Evidence-oriented conservatives
- Business interests (workforce)
- State innovators
- Recipient voices
- Research community

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Years 1-3)

### Federal Administrative Actions

**Executive Orders and Agency Guidance** (Day 1 - Year 1):

| Action | Agency | Timeline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Interagency coordination council | EOP | Month 1 |
| Data sharing directive | OMB | Month 3 |
| Burden reduction guidance | HHS, USDA | Month 6 |
| Pilot program authority expansion | All | Month 6 |
| Cliff mapping requirement | HHS | Month 12 |

**Regulatory Changes** (Year 1-2):

| Regulation | Description | Timeline |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| SNAP reporting | Extend recertification periods | Year 1 |
| Medicaid continuous eligibility | 12-month minimum | Year 1 |

## Phase 3: Structural Reform (Years 4-7)

### Benefit Cliff Elimination

**Coordinated Phase-Out Design**:
- Cap combined EMTR at 60-70%
- Align phase-out ranges across programs
- Create transition buffers
- Coordinate income definitions

**Program-by-Program Implementation**:

| Program | Reform | Timeline |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Medicaid | 24-month transition coverage | Year 4 |
| Childcare | Extended phase-out to 300% FPL | Year 4 |
| Housing | Continued sliding scale | Year 5 |
| SNAP | Coordinated with other phase-outs | Year 5 |
| EITC | Extended for childless workers | Year 5 |

### Eligibility Harmonization

**Income Definition Alignment**:
- Common income definition across programs
- Common time period (monthly or annual)
- Common disregards
- Common verification standards

**Household Definition Alignment**:
- Common unit definition
- Coordination across programs
- Simplified reporting

### Work Requirement Reform

**Replace Punitive Requirements with Supports**:
- Voluntary employment services
- Education and training valued
- Barrier assessment and assistance
- Support rather than sanction

**Alternative Accountability**:
- Outcome-based measures
- Program effectiveness metrics
- Work incentive focus
- Support service availability

## Phase 4: Comprehensive Integration (Years 7-10)

### Program Consolidation Options

**Option A: Coordinated But Separate**
- Maintain program identities
- Unified delivery system
- Coordinated eligibility
- Shared administration

**Option B: Partial Consolidation**
- Merge cash programs (TANF, SSI, GA)
- Integrate income support delivery
- Maintain specialized services
- Common eligibility for core benefits

**Option C: Comprehensive Integration**
