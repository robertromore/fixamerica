# Safety Net Design: History

## Pre-New Deal Era (Before 1935)

### Poor Relief Tradition

**Colonial and Early American Approach**:
- Local responsibility for "deserving poor"
- Almshouses and poorhouses
- "Settlement laws" restricting mobility
- Distinction between worthy and unworthy poor
- Moral judgments embedded in assistance

**Categories of Deserving Poor**:
- Widows with children
- Orphans
- Elderly without family
- Disabled unable to work

**Undeserving Poor**:
- Able-bodied men
- Single mothers (in some views)
- Migrants and transients
- Those deemed morally deficient

### State-Level Programs

**Mothers' Pensions (1911-1935)**:
- First systematic public assistance
- 40 states by 1920
- Benefits for "worthy" widows
- Highly discretionary
- Excluded Black families in many states
- Basis for later AFDC

**Old Age Assistance** (state programs):
- Patchwork of state programs
- Inadequate and variable
- Set stage for Social Security

## The New Deal Foundation (1935-1965)

### Social Security Act of 1935

**Created a Two-Track System**:

| Track | Programs | Design |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Social Insurance** | Old Age Insurance, Unemployment Insurance | Universal, contributory, dignified |
| **Public Assistance** | ADC, OAA, AB | Means-tested, state-run, stigmatized |

**Aid to Dependent Children (ADC)**:
- Federal matching grants to states
- State-set eligibility and benefits
- Designed primarily for white widows
- Excluded agricultural and domestic workers
- "Suitable home" requirements
- Local discretion in administration

**Institutional Design Choices**:
- Federalism preserved: States control welfare
- Contributory vs. means-tested distinction
- Racial exclusions built in
- Local administration with federal oversight

### Racial Exclusions

**Deliberate Design**:
- Southern Democrats demanded state control
- Agricultural and domestic worker exclusions
- Affected 65% of Black workers
- "Suitable home" and "man in the house" rules
- Local administration enabled discrimination

**Effect**:
- ADC primarily served white widows initially
- Black families systematically excluded
- Welfare stigmatized as programs diversified
- Legacy shapes current debates

### Post-War Expansion

**Program Additions**:
- 1950: Aid to Disabled added
- 1962: ADC becomes AFDC (families included)
- Social services amendments
- Gradual expansion of eligibility

**Growing Caseloads**:
- Great Migration brought Black families to Northern cities
- Caseloads expanded beyond widows
- Welfare rights movement demanded access
- By 1970: 10 million AFDC recipients

## The Fragmentation Begins (1965-1980)

### Great Society Programs

**1964-1968: Massive Expansion**

| Year | Program | Agency | Purpose |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| 1964 | Food Stamps | USDA | Nutrition |
| 1965 | Medicare | HHS | Health (elderly) |
| 1965 | Medicaid | HHS | Health (poor) |
| 1965 | Head Start | HHS | Early childhood |
| 1965 | Elementary/Secondary Education Act | Education | School funding |
| 1968 | Housing Act | HUD | Housing assistance |

**Why Separate Programs?**

Political and institutional factors drove fragmentation:
- Different congressional committees
- Different executive agencies
- Different constituencies
- Different political coalitions
- Categorical funding easier to pass
- Specificity prevented "waste"

### Rise of In-Kind Benefits

**Shift from Cash to Vouchers**:

| Period | Cash vs. In-Kind |
|--------|-----------------|
| 1960 | Mostly cash (AFDC) |
| 1970 | Mixed (AFDC + Food Stamps + Medicaid) |
| 1980 | In-kind dominant |
| Today | In-kind vastly exceeds cash |

**Reasons for In-Kind Preference**:
- Paternalism: Control how benefits spent
- Political: Food/housing/health more popular than cash
- Interest groups: Farmers, healthcare industry, landlords
- Fraud concerns: Cash seen as more fungible
- "Deserving" distinction: Needs-specific aid

### Earned Income Tax Credit (1975)

**Created as Work Incentive**:
- Small credit initially
- Delivered through tax system
- Rewarded work rather than replaced income
- Bipartisan support
- Would become largest anti-poverty program

**Design Significance**:
- Bypassed welfare bureaucracy
- Reduced stigma
- Created new delivery channel
- But annual rather than monthly
- Excludes non-filers

### Food Stamp Expansion

**From Pilot to National Program**:
- 1961: Pilot programs
- 1964: Food Stamp Act
- 1971: National requirements
- 1977: Eliminated purchase requirement

**Structural Features**:
- USDA administration (not HHS)
- Federal funding (unlike AFDC)
- Federal eligibility rules
- State administration
- In-kind (food only)

### Supplemental Security Income (1972)

**Federalized Aged/Blind/Disabled Programs**:
- Replaced state programs with federal
- Uniform national benefit
- SSA administration
- Cash assistance
- Still has asset limits, means-testing

**Significance**:
- One successful integration effort
- Shows federalization possible
- But rigid categorical requirements
- Asset limits frozen since 1989

## Retrenchment Era (1980-1996)

### Reagan Administration

**Philosophy Shift**:
- Government as problem
- Dependency as concern
- Work requirements emphasized
- Block grants proposed

**Policy Changes**:
- OBRA 1981: AFDC cuts
- Tighter eligibility
- Work requirements
- State flexibility

### Family Support Act of 1988

**Bipartisan Compromise**:
- JOBS program (work and training)
- Transitional benefits
- Child support enforcement
- Child care funding

**Significance**:
- Accepted work requirements principle
- Set stage for 1996
- Transition benefits concept
- Bipartisan approach possible

### State Waiver Era (1992-1996)

**Laboratories of Democracy**:
- Clinton granted extensive waivers
- States experimented with:
    - Time limits
    - Work requirements
    - Family caps
    - Sanctions

**Notable Experiments**:
- Wisconsin W-2
- Michigan work-first
- Multiple state approaches
- Set stage for federal reform

## Welfare Reform (1996)

### Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act

**Fundamental Restructuring**:

| Feature | AFDC (Before) | TANF (After) |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **Funding** | Open-ended matching | Fixed block grant |
| **Entitlement** | Individual right | No individual right |
| **Federal control** | Eligibility rules | Work participation rates |
| **Time limits** | None | 60-month lifetime |
| **Work requirements** | Limited | Mandatory |
| **State flexibility** | Constrained | Nearly unlimited |

**Immediate Effects**:
- Caseload decline: 12.3M to 4.5M (1996-2006)
- Work participation increase
- Poverty reduction (initially)
- Program transformation

### Block Grant Consequences

**$16.5 Billion Frozen**:
- No inflation adjustment
- No population adjustment
- No recession trigger
- Real value eroded 40%+

**State Response**:
- Redirected funds from cash assistance
- By 2020: Only 24% to basic assistance
- Funds to other state priorities
- "Rainy day" reserves accumulated

### Work Requirements in Practice

**Federal Requirements**:
- 50% participation rate
- Limited countable activities
- Education restricted
- Sanctions for non-compliance

**Reality**:
- Many cannot meet requirements
- Exemptions limited
- Sanctions common
- Caseload reduction prioritized

## Post-Reform Evolution (1997-2020)

### EITC Expansion

**Largest Anti-Poverty Program**:
- Multiple expansions
- Higher credits
- Broader eligibility
- Marriage penalty reduction
- Childless worker expansion (limited)

**Current Scale**:
- $60+ billion annually
- 25 million families
- Largest refund for many workers

### SNAP Restoration and Expansion

**Post-Reform Changes**:
- 2002: Some immigrant eligibility restored
- 2008: Farm Bill improvements
- 2009: ARRA benefit increase
- 2010: Benefit boost made permanent briefly

**But Also**:
- ABAWD time limits
- Work requirements
- State flexibility in administration

### Children's Health Insurance Program (1997)

**Filled Medicaid Gap**:
- Higher income eligibility
- State flexibility
- Federal matching
- Expanded coverage

**Design**:
- Separate from Medicaid (in most states)
- Additional application sometimes
- Added to program complexity

### ACA Medicaid Expansion (2010)

**Expanded Eligibility**:
- To 138% FPL
- For all adults
- Federal funding (90%+)
- Supreme Court made optional

**Fragmentation Effects**:
- Coverage gap in non-expansion states
- Different eligibility than other programs
- Cliff effects created

## COVID-19 Era (2020-2023)

### Emergency Expansions

| Program | Change | Duration |
|---------|--------|----------|
| SNAP | 15%+ benefit increase | Temporary |
| EITC | Expanded for childless | One year |
| CTC | $3,600 per child, monthly | 2021 only |
| Medicaid | Continuous enrollment | Through 2023 |
| Unemployment | $600/week supplement | Temporary |
| Housing | Eviction moratorium | Temporary |

### Child Tax Credit Expansion (2021)

**Historic Change**:
- $3,600 per child under 6
- $3,000 per child 6-17
- Monthly advance payments
- Fully refundable
- Nearly universal

**Results**:
- Child poverty cut nearly in half
- 3.7 million children lifted from poverty
- Monthly payments more useful than annual
- Demonstrated feasibility

**Expiration**:
- Not extended beyond 2021
- Child poverty rebounded to pre-COVID levels
- Demonstrated political fragility

### Medicaid Unwinding

**Continuous Enrollment Ending**:
- 15+ million facing disenrollment
- Procedural issues dominant
- Coverage gaps created
- Administrative burden revealed

## Lessons from History

### Why Fragmentation Persists

**Institutional Factors**:
- Congressional committee jurisdictions
- Executive agency turf
- Federal-state division
- Professional interests

**Political Factors**:
- Categorical programs easier to pass
- Different coalitions for different programs
- Incrementalism is path of least resistance
- Integration threatens existing interests

**Ideological Factors**:
- "Deserving" distinctions
- Work vs. dependency frame
- Cash vs. in-kind debates
- Federal vs. state control

### What Integration Efforts Have Worked

**Successful Examples**:
- SSI federalization (1972)
- EITC (simple, tax-delivered)
- School meal categorical eligibility
- Express Lane Eligibility (limited)

**Why They Worked**:
- Clear federal authority
- Simple design
- Limited stakeholder resistance
- Bipartisan support

### What Integration Efforts Have Failed

**Failed Examples**:
- Nixon's Family Assistance Plan
- Carter's welfare reform
- Multiple block grant proposals
- Comprehensive integration plans

**Why They Failed**:
- Political opposition from multiple directions
- Complexity of transition
- Stakeholder resistance
- Federalism constraints

### Historical Patterns

| Pattern | Example | Lesson |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Crisis enables change | Great Society, COVID | Windows of opportunity matter |
| Expansion easier than reform | New programs vs. integration | Adding is easier than changing |
| Retrenchment follows expansion | 1980s, 1996 | Backlash predictable |
| Race shapes policy | ADC exclusions, TANF | Cannot ignore racial politics |
| Incrementalism dominates | Most reforms | Comprehensive change rare |
