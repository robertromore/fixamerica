# Safety Net Design: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

### Work Must Always Pay

Reform must ensure that working more always increases family income:
- No marginal tax rates above 70%
- No cliff effects where small raises cause large losses
- Gradual phase-outs across programs
- Coordination to prevent stacking

### Simplicity Reduces Burden

Administrative systems should be as simple as possible:
- Single application for multiple programs
- Shared data across agencies
- Presumptive eligibility where appropriate
- Minimal documentation requirements

### Stability Enables Planning

Families need predictable, stable support:
- Continuous eligibility periods
- Gradual transitions rather than sudden cutoffs
- Protection from administrative churn
- Counter-cyclical design for recessions

### Dignity in Design

Programs should treat recipients with respect:
- Assume good faith
- Minimize surveillance
- Respect autonomy
- Reduce stigma

### Adequacy for Basic Needs

Benefits must be sufficient to meet fundamental needs:
- Poverty-level minimums
- Regional cost adjustment
- Inflation indexing
- Recognition of actual costs

## Core Structural Reforms

### Benefit Cliff Elimination

**Problem**: Effective marginal tax rates can exceed 100% at certain income levels.

**Solution Framework**:

1. **Identify cliff points** across all major programs
2. **Coordinate phase-out rates** to cap combined EMTR at 60-70%
3. **Extend phase-out ranges** where cliffs are sharp
4. **Create transition buffers** at key thresholds

**Technical Design**:

| Program | Current Design | Reformed Design |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Medicaid | Hard cliff at 138% FPL | 24-month transition to marketplace |
| Childcare | Often cliff at 200% FPL | Gradual phase-out to 300% FPL |
| Housing | 30% of income | Continue sliding scale beyond eligibility |
| SNAP | 30% benefit reduction rate | Coordinate with other phase-outs |

**Estimated Impact**:
- Eliminate 100%+ EMTR zones
- Improve work incentives at key margins
- Reduce cliff-induced poverty traps

### Integrated Eligibility System

**Problem**: Multiple applications, documentation, and recertifications.

**Solution Framework**:

1. **Single Application Portal**:
    - Apply for all programs in one place
    - Answer questions once
    - Upload documents once
    - Receive coordinated determination

2. **Shared Data Infrastructure**:
    - Common client record
    - Real-time income verification (IRS, employers)
    - Cross-program data sharing
    - Privacy protections maintained

3. **Aligned Eligibility Rules**:
    - Common income definition
    - Common household definition
    - Common documentation standards
    - Common recertification schedules

**Implementation Path**:
- Phase 1: Common application interface (3 years)
- Phase 2: Backend data sharing (5 years)
- Phase 3: Eligibility rule alignment (7 years)

### Administrative Burden Reduction

**Problem**: 20-40 hours to apply for and maintain benefits.

**Solution Framework**:

**Application Simplification**:
- Online/mobile applications
- Presumptive eligibility from tax data
- Self-attestation with verification
- No in-person interview requirement

**Documentation Reduction**:
- Accept self-attestation for most items
- Electronic verification of income
- Cross-program document sharing
- One-time submission, persistent record

**Recertification Reform**:
- 12-month minimum eligibility periods
- 24-month for stable households
- Administrative renewal using existing data
- Proactive renewal notices

**Change Reporting**:
- Eliminate 10-day reporting requirements
- Quarterly or semi-annual reporting
- Real-time income adjustment (optional)
- Grace periods before sanctions

### Asset Limit Modernization

**Problem**: Asset limits trap families in poverty, punish savings.

**Solution Framework**:

**Near-Term**: Eliminate or raise limits
- Raise SSI limits from $2,000 to $10,000+
- Index to inflation going forward
- Expand excluded assets
- Eliminate vehicle equity limits

**Medium-Term**: Remove asset tests entirely
- Evidence shows limits don't serve purpose
- Administrative savings significant
- Other countries don't use such limits
- Focus on income, not assets

**Transition Protection**:
- Gradual phase-in
- No loss from elimination
- Financial education support

### Time Limit Reform

**Problem**: Arbitrary cutoffs regardless of circumstances.

**Solution Framework**:

**TANF Time Limits**:
- Eliminate federal 60-month limit
- Prohibit state lifetime limits
- Replace with engagement requirements
- Maintain support during participation

**SNAP ABAWD Limits**:
- Eliminate 3-month time limit
- Replace with voluntary employment services
- Recognize structural unemployment
- Maintain broad waiver authority

**Alternative Approach**:
- Assessment-based rather than time-based
- Recognize barriers to employment
- Support rather than punishment
- Evaluation of individual circumstances
