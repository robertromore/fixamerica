# Safety Net Design: Overview

## Executive Summary

America's safety net is not a coordinated system but a patchwork of 80+ means-tested programs operating across multiple agencies with conflicting rules, different eligibility criteria, and incompatible administrative systems. This fragmentation creates severe consequences: effective marginal tax rates exceeding 100% at certain income levels, benefit cliffs that cost families $10,000+ for small wage increases, administrative churn that causes 12 million people to lose Medicaid annually, and bureaucratic burdens that consume 10-15% of program budgets. The average TANF recipient must navigate 3+ separate agencies, each with its own application, documentation requirements, and recertification schedules.

These design flaws are not inevitable. Other developed nations operate unified systems that deliver benefits efficiently without creating poverty traps. The fundamental problem is that America's safety net evolved program-by-program over decades without systematic coordination, creating a system that is simultaneously inadequate for those in need and punitive for those trying to escape poverty. Integration, simplification, and cliff elimination are technically feasible but face significant political and institutional barriers.

## Scope

## The Core Problem

### The Patchwork System

America's safety net comprises dozens of programs created at different times for different purposes:

| Category | Major Programs | Agencies |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Cash** | TANF, SSI, GA | HHS, SSA, States |
| **Food** | SNAP, WIC, School Meals, TEFAP | USDA, States |
| **Healthcare** | Medicaid, CHIP, ACA subsidies | HHS, States |
| **Housing** | Section 8, Public Housing, LIHTC | HUD, States |
| **Energy** | LIHEAP, Weatherization | HHS, DOE |
| **Childcare** | CCDF, Head Start, TANF childcare | HHS, States |
| **Tax Credits** | EITC, CTC, CDCTC | Treasury/IRS |
| **Education** | Pell, Free lunch eligibility | Education, USDA |

Each program has:

- Different eligibility rules (income limits, asset tests, categorical requirements)
- Different applications and verification requirements
- Different agencies and caseworkers
- Different recertification schedules
- Different benefit calculation methods

### The Benefit Cliff Problem

When workers earn more, they often lose more in benefits than they gain in wages:

**Example: Single Parent with Two Children in Pennsylvania**

| Annual Earnings | Total Benefits | Net Income | Marginal Tax Rate |
|-----------------|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| $15,000 | $24,000 | $39,000 | -- |
| $20,000 | $18,500 | $38,500 | **110%** |
| $25,000 | $14,000 | $39,000 | 90% |
| $30,000 | $8,000 | $38,000 | **120%** |
| $35,000 | $5,000 | $40,000 | 60% |

A $5,000 raise from $25,000 to $30,000 actually leaves the family $1,000 poorer.

### The Administrative Burden

Families must navigate:

| Requirement | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Multiple applications | 3-5 separate applications for common benefit packages |
| Documentation | Birth certificates, pay stubs, utility bills, landlord verification |
| Interviews | Often required in-person during business hours |
| Recertification | Quarterly to annual, different schedules per program |
| Change reporting | Often 10-day reporting windows with penalties |
| Appeals | Separate process for each program |

**The Cost of Complexity**:

- Families: 20-40 hours to apply for and maintain benefits
- Government: 10-15% of program budgets on administration
- Society: Eligible non-participants leave billions unclaimed

### The Churn Problem

Millions cycle on and off programs not because circumstances changed but because of administrative failures:

| Cause | Annual Impact |
|-------|---------------|
| Failed recertification | 12 million lose Medicaid |
| Documentation issues | Millions lose SNAP |
| Reporting failures | TANF sanctions affect 1 million+ |
| System errors | Uncounted but significant |

**Cost of Churn**:
- Administrative cost of re-enrollment
- Coverage gaps during transition
- Health and nutrition consequences
- Family stress and instability

## By the Numbers

### Program Fragmentation

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Means-tested programs (federal) | 80+ |
| Federal agencies administering programs | 20+ |
| State agencies a family may interact with | 3-5 |
| Average applications needed | 3-5 |
| Different income definitions used | 12+ |

### Effective Marginal Tax Rates

| Income Range | Typical EMTR | Peak EMTR |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| $0-$10,000 | 30-40% | 50% |
| $10,000-$20,000 | 40-60% | 80% |
| $20,000-$30,000 | 50-80% | 100%+ |
| $30,000-$40,000 | 40-70% | 100%+ |
| $40,000-$50,000 | 30-50% | 80% |

### Administrative Costs

| Program | Admin Cost Share |
|---------|------------------|
| SNAP | 6-8% |
| Medicaid | 5-7% |
| TANF | 10-15% |
| Housing vouchers | 8-10% |
| SSI | 3-4% |
| EITC | 1% |

Tax-based delivery (EITC) is most efficient; categorical programs with heavy verification are most costly.

### Program Participation Rates

| Program | Participation Rate |
|---------|-------------------|
| Social Security | 95%+ |
| Medicare | 95%+ |
| SNAP | 82% |
| Medicaid (eligible) | 85% |
| EITC | 78% |
| TANF | 21% |
| Housing assistance | 24% |

Universal programs achieve near-complete participation; means-tested programs leave millions uncovered.

### Churn Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual Medicaid disenrollment | 12 million |
| Re-enrolled within 12 months | 8 million |
| SNAP churn rate | 30% annually |
| TANF average spell | 18 months |
| Administrative vs. circumstance churn | ~50% administrative |

## Key Concepts

### Effective Marginal Tax Rate (EMTR)

The total tax on each additional dollar earned, including:
- Federal income tax
- Payroll tax
- State income tax
- Benefit phase-outs (lost SNAP, Medicaid, housing, childcare)

**Formula**: EMTR = (Taxes paid + Benefits lost) / Additional earnings

**The Problem**: When EMTR exceeds 100%, working more makes families poorer.

### Benefit Cliff vs. Gradual Phase-Out

**Cliff**: Benefits end entirely at income threshold
- Example: Medicaid eligibility ends at 138% FPL

**Gradual Phase-Out**: Benefits reduce as income rises
- Example: SNAP reduces 30 cents per dollar of income

**Extended Transition**: Benefits phase out very gradually
- Example: EITC phase-out at 15.98% for families

Cliffs create the most severe work disincentives; gradual phase-outs minimize them.

### Administrative Burden

The costs imposed on applicants through:
- **Learning costs**: Understanding eligibility and application process
- **Compliance costs**: Gathering documentation, attending interviews
- **Psychological costs**: Stigma, stress, uncertainty

Research shows administrative burden falls disproportionately on those with fewest resources.

### Categorical Eligibility

Many programs restrict eligibility to specific categories:
- Parents with children (TANF)
- Elderly and disabled (SSI)
- Pregnant women and young children (WIC)

"Deserving poor" distinctions leave many in need ineligible.

### Asset Tests

Limits on savings and property that disqualify otherwise-eligible applicants:

| Program | Asset Limit |
|---------|-------------|
| SSI | $2,000 individual |
| SNAP (most states) | No limit (categorical) |
| TANF | $1,000-$10,000 by state |
| Medicaid | Varies by category |

Asset limits punish saving and trap families in poverty.

|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Multiple agencies** | HHS, USDA, HUD | High |
| **Federal/state split** | Medicaid, TANF | Very high |
| **Different income rules** | Gross vs. net | Medium |
| **Different time periods** | Monthly vs. annual | Medium |
| **Categorical requirements** | Who qualifies | High |
| **Asset tests** | Savings limits | Medium |
| **Work requirements** | Different across programs | Medium |

## Why This Matters

### For Families in Poverty

- Navigating multiple systems is exhausting and time-consuming
- Benefit cliffs create impossible choices about work
- Administrative failures cause sudden benefit losses
- System complexity prevents accessing entitled benefits

### For Workers Trying to Advance

- Working more can mean earning less
- Promotions and raises trigger benefit losses
- Career advancement carries financial penalties
- Asset building is punished

### For Taxpayers

- Administrative costs waste resources
- Churn creates repeated enrollment costs
- Non-participation leaves need unmet, increasing other costs
- Complexity creates opportunities for error and fraud

### For Government Effectiveness

- Siloed programs cannot achieve coordinated outcomes
- Measurement of success is program-specific, not family-centered
- Innovation is constrained by categorical rules
- System cannot adapt to changing labor markets

### For Society

- Poverty persists despite massive spending
- Work is discouraged at critical transition points
- Asset building is prevented for those who need it most
- Trust in government is undermined
