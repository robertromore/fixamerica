# Child Poverty: Root Causes

## Why Child Poverty Persists

Child poverty in America is not inevitable. Other wealthy nations have child poverty rates 2-4 times lower than ours. The United States produces more than enough wealth to ensure no child grows up poor. Child poverty persists because of how we structure labor markets, design policy, and distribute resources. Understanding these root causes is essential to designing effective solutions.

## Economic Causes

### Low Wages for Parents

**The Minimum Wage Problem**

| Year | Federal Minimum | 2024 Value | Full-Time Annual |
|------|-----------------|------------|------------------|
| 1968 | $1.60 | $14.00+ | $29,120 |
| 2009 | $7.25 | $10.14 | $21,090 |
| 2024 | $7.25 | $7.25 | $15,080 |

**Why Low Wages Cause Child Poverty**

- Full-time minimum wage: $15,080/year
- Poverty line for family of 3: $25,820
- Even full-time work leaves families with children poor
- 28% of workers with children earn less than $15/hour

**Wage Structure for Parents**

| Percentile | Hourly Wage | Annual (FT) | Family of 3 Status |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 10th | $11.40 | $23,700 | Below poverty |
| 20th | $14.00 | $29,120 | Near poverty |
| 30th | $16.80 | $34,940 | 135% of poverty |

### Job Quality Decline

**Erosion of Good Jobs**

| Factor | Trend | Impact on Families |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Full-time availability | More part-time | Insufficient hours |
| Benefits | Fewer with health, retirement | Medical poverty risk |
| Stability | More temporary, contingent | Income volatility |
| Scheduling | Unpredictable hours | Childcare impossible |
| Career ladders | Fewer promotions | Stuck at low wages |

**Sectors Where Parents Work**

| Sector | Low-Wage Share | Parents Employed |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| Retail | 65% | Millions |
| Food service | 75% | Millions |
| Home health | 70% | Millions (mostly mothers) |
| Childcare | 75% | Mostly women |
| Warehousing | 55% | Growing |

### Unemployment and Underemployment

**Parental Employment**

| Status | Child Poverty Rate |
|--------|-------------------|
| Both parents full-time | 4.8% |
| One parent full-time | 12.3% |
| Part-time only | 25%+ |
| No parent employed | 54.2% |

**Barriers to Parental Employment**

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Childcare unavailability | Cannot work without care |
| Childcare cost | Not worth working |
| Scheduling conflicts | Care and work don't align |
| Health problems | Parent or child illness |
| Disability | Parent or child |
| Transportation | Cannot get to jobs |

### The Childcare Dilemma

**Costs vs. Earnings**

| Family Type | Childcare Cost | Average Earnings | Net Income |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| Single mother, low wage | $10,000-15,000 | $25,000 | $10,000-15,000 |
| Two parents, one low wage | $12,000-20,000 | $45,000 | $25,000-33,000 |
| Two low-wage parents, 2 kids | $20,000-30,000 | $50,000 | $20,000-30,000 |

**The Math Doesn't Work**

- Average infant care: $1,230/month ($14,760/year)
- Many low-wage parents would work for free or pay to work
- Rational to leave workforce or work less
- Children lose both income and care quality

**Childcare Availability**

| Issue | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| Childcare deserts | 51% of Americans in areas with insufficient supply |
| Hours mismatch | Care unavailable for non-standard shifts |
| Infant care | Most scarce, most expensive |
| Quality | Variable; affordability vs. quality tradeoff |

## Family Structure

### Single Parenthood and Child Poverty

**The Numbers**

| Family Type | Child Poverty Rate |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Married-couple families | 7.5% |
| Single-mother families | 35.0% |
| Single-father families | 18.3% |

**Why Single-Parent Families Face Higher Poverty**

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| One earner | Half the earning potential |
| Childcare needs | More acute, more expensive |
| Time constraints | Cannot work overtime, second job |
| Less flexibility | Cannot cover for sick child as easily |
| Child support gaps | Often insufficient or unpaid |

### But Family Structure Is Not Destiny

**International Comparison**

| Country | Single-Parent Child Poverty |
|---------|----------------------------|
| Denmark | 8% |
| Sweden | 11% |
| France | 23% |
| UK | 31% |
| **United States** | **35-40%** |

**What Other Countries Do Differently**

| Policy | U.S. | Peer Nations |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Child allowance | No (limited CTC) | Universal |
| Paid parental leave | None (federal) | 6-18 months |
| Childcare | Limited subsidies | Universal/subsidized |
| Healthcare | Employment-tied | Universal |
| Minimum wage | $7.25 | Higher, indexed |

Single parenthood is a risk factor, but policy determines whether it means poverty.

### Father Absence and Child Support

**Child Support Gaps**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Children owed child support | 13.5 million |
| Full amount received | 43.5% of custodial parents |
| No payment received | 30% |
| Average annual payment | $3,447 |

**Why Child Support Falls Short**

- Many fathers have low incomes themselves
- Enforcement challenging
- Incarceration reduces earning ability
- System creates adversarial relationships

## Policy Failures

### The Child Tax Credit Design Flaw

**Current CTC (Post-2021)**

| Element | Design | Problem |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Refundability | Partial (up to $1,700) | Poorest excluded |
| Phase-in | 15% of earnings above $2,500 | Requires work |
| Maximum | $2,000 | Inadequate |
| Delivery | Annual | No monthly stability |

**Who Gets Left Out**

| Family Earnings | CTC Amount | Need Level |
|-----------------|------------|------------|
| $0 | $0 | Highest |
| $10,000 | $1,125 | High |
| $20,000 | $2,000 | Moderate |
| $50,000 | $2,000 | Lower |

**The poorest children receive the smallest benefits**

### TANF's Collapse

**TANF's Failure to Reach Children**

| Metric | 1996 | 2023 |
|--------|------|------|
| Families receiving aid | 4.4 million | ~1 million |
| Share of poor families | 68% | 21% |
| Block grant (nominal) | $16.5 billion | $16.5 billion |
| Block grant (real) | $16.5 billion | ~$10 billion |

**Why TANF Doesn't Reach Children**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Block grant frozen | States have less to spend |
| Time limits | Families cut off regardless of need |
| Work requirements | Sanctions for non-compliance |
| State diversion | Only 24% goes to cash assistance |
| Administrative burden | Many don't apply or are denied |

### The Benefits Cliff

**How the Cliff Traps Children in Poverty**

| Income Level | Benefits Lost |
|--------------|---------------|
| $15,000 | May lose TANF |
| $25,000 | May lose Medicaid |
| $30,000 | May lose childcare assistance |
| $35,000 | May lose SNAP, EITC phases down |
| $45,000 | May lose housing assistance |

**Effective Marginal Tax Rates**

- Can exceed 100% at cliff points
- Parent gets a raise; family loses more in benefits
- Rational not to advance
- Children trapped at poverty line

### Absence of Universal Child Benefit

**The U.S. Exception**

| Country | Has Universal Child Benefit? |
|---------|------------------------------|
| Canada | Yes (Canada Child Benefit) |
| Germany | Yes (Kindergeld) |
| UK | Yes (Child Benefit) |
| France | Yes |
| Australia | Yes |
| **United States** | **No** |

**Why This Matters**

- Other countries acknowledge cost of raising children
- Universal benefit reaches all children
- Not conditioned on parental work
- Simple administration
- U.S. child poverty 2-3x higher partly because of this gap

## Social and Demographic Factors

### Racial Disparities

**Child Poverty by Race**

| Group | Rate | Ratio to White |
|-------|------|----------------|
| White | 10.5% | 1.0x |
| Black | 26.5% | 2.5x |
| Hispanic | 22.3% | 2.1x |
| Native American | 29.1% | 2.8x |

**Causes of Racial Gaps**

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Wage discrimination | Lower pay for same work |
| Employment discrimination | Harder to get hired |
| Occupational segregation | Concentrated in low-wage jobs |
| Wealth gap | No family safety net |
| Housing discrimination | Concentrated in poor areas |
| Educational inequality | Underfunded schools |
| Mass incarceration | Fathers absent, earning impaired |

**Historical Causes**

| Era | Discrimination |
|-----|----------------|
| Slavery | No wealth accumulation |
| Jim Crow | Economic exclusion |
| New Deal | Excluded from programs |
| GI Bill | Unequal access |
| Redlining | Excluded from homeownership |
| Today | Ongoing discrimination |

### Geographic Concentration

**Why Place Matters for Children**

| Factor | High-Poverty Areas |
|--------|-------------------|
| Schools | Underfunded, lower quality |
| Healthcare | Fewer providers |
| Jobs | Fewer opportunities |
| Safety | Higher violence |
| Environment | More pollution |
| Services | Fewer resources |

**Persistent Child Poverty Areas**

| Region | Root Cause |
|--------|------------|
| Mississippi Delta | Slavery legacy, agricultural decline |
| Central Appalachia | Coal economy collapse |
| Rio Grande Valley | Border isolation, discrimination |
| Native reservations | Treaty violations, isolation |
| Inner cities | Redlining, deindustrialization |

### Parental Education

**Education and Child Poverty**

| Parent Education | Child Poverty Rate |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Less than high school | 35.6% |
| High school diploma | 21.8% |
| Some college | 14.3% |
| Bachelor's degree | 5.6% |

**Why Education Matters**

- Higher wages
- Better job quality
- More stability
- Better able to navigate systems
- Intergenerational transmission

**But Education Cannot Solve Everything**

- College-educated Black families still face higher child poverty than white high school graduates
- Structural factors persist at every education level
- Not everyone can or should get college degree
- Low-education jobs must also pay living wages

### Health and Disability

**Parental Health and Child Poverty**

| Condition | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Physical disability | 24% poverty rate (working-age adults) |
| Mental health conditions | Higher poverty rates |
| Chronic illness | Work limitations, medical costs |
| Substance use disorders | Employment, stability affected |

**Child Health and Poverty**

| Condition | Effect on Family |
|-----------|------------------|
| Chronic illness | Caregiving demands, medical costs |
| Disability | Requires care, limits parent work |
| Mental health | Services needed, behavior challenges |

**The Health-Poverty Cycle**

## Intergenerational Transmission

### How Child Poverty Perpetuates

**Mechanisms of Transmission**

| Mechanism | Path |
|-----------|------|
| Brain development | Poverty impairs development |
| Education | Worse schools, worse outcomes |
| Health | Childhood poverty harms adult health |
| Wealth | No inheritance, no head start |
| Networks | Limited connections to opportunity |
| Trauma | ACEs affect development, behavior |

### The Developmental Effects

**Early Childhood (0-5)**

| Effect | Long-Term Impact |
|--------|-----------------|
| Reduced brain volume | Lower cognitive capacity |
| Stress hormones | Impaired self-regulation |
| Language exposure gap | School unreadiness |
| Toxic stress | Mental health vulnerability |

**School Age (6-17)**

| Effect | Long-Term Impact |
|--------|-----------------|
| Lower achievement | Fewer educational credentials |
| Behavior problems | School discipline, disengagement |
| Health problems | Chronic conditions |
| Instability | Mobility, relationship disruption |

### Mobility Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Children born poor who stay poor | 33% remain in bottom quintile |
| Children born poor reaching top | 7.5% reach top quintile |
| Intergenerational earnings correlation | 0.5 (higher = less mobility) |
| U.S. vs. peer nations | Less mobile than most |

## Political and Ideological Causes

### Anti-Poverty Policy Opposition

**Dominant Narratives**

| Narrative | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| "Dependency" | Benefits harm families |
| "Work ethic" | Only workers deserve help |
| "Family values" | Single parents blamed |
| "Personal responsibility" | Poverty is individual failure |
| "Taxpayer money" | Benefits seen as taking |

**How Narratives Harm Children**

- Children blamed for parents' circumstances
- Support conditioned on parental behavior
- Work requirements leave children without
- "Deserving" distinction applied to innocent children

### Political Economy of Child Poverty

**Why Policy Doesn't Do More**

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Children can't vote | No direct political voice |
| Poor parents vote less | Underrepresented |
| Wealthy influence | Campaign contributions, lobbying |
| Racial politics | Anti-poverty racialized |
| Federalism | State-level resistance |

### Multiple Causes in Action

**Example: Single Mother with Two Children in Poverty**

| Cause | Contribution |
|-------|--------------|
| Gender wage gap | Earns 80 cents on dollar |
| Occupational segregation | In low-wage female job |
| One earner | No second income |
| Childcare costs | $15,000-20,000/year |
| Father's limited support | Only $3,000/year |
| CTC limitations | Only $3,400 (partial refund) |
| TANF unavailable | Rejected or didn't apply |
| Benefits cliff | Would lose Medicaid if earned more |
| Geography | Lives in high-poverty area |
| History | Grew up poor herself |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Low wages are fundamental**: Working parents cannot escape poverty
2. **Childcare creates impossible tradeoffs**: Cost exceeds what many can earn
3. **Family structure matters but isn't destiny**: Policy can compensate
4. **CTC design excludes poorest**: Phase-in leaves neediest behind
5. **TANF collapsed as safety net**: Only 21% of poor families reached
6. **No universal child benefit**: Unlike every peer nation
7. **Racial discrimination compounds**: 2-3x higher rates for children of color
8. **Intergenerational transmission**: Poverty passes to next generation
9. **Political neglect**: Children can't vote; poor parents underrepresented
10. **Other countries do better**: Proves child poverty is policy choice
