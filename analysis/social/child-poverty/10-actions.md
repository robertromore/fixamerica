# Child Poverty: Actions for Citizens

## Overview

Reducing child poverty requires collective action, but that action starts with individuals. Children cannot advocate for themselves--they need adults to speak on their behalf. Whether you have an hour, a day, or a lifetime to dedicate, there are meaningful ways to help ensure no child grows up in poverty.
