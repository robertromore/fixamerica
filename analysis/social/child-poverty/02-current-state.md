# Child Poverty: Current State

## The Problem Today

### America's Child Poverty Crisis

More than 11 million American children live in poverty--one in every six. This rate is among the highest in the developed world, 2-3 times that of most peer nations. The 2021 Child Tax Credit expansion proved that bold policy can cut child poverty nearly in half. Its expiration in 2022 immediately reversed those gains, demonstrating that child poverty in America is a choice--and currently, we are choosing to let millions of children suffer.

**Key Current Statistics (2022)**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Children in poverty | 11.6 million |
| Child poverty rate (OPM) | 16.3% |
| Child poverty rate (SPM) | 12.4% |
| Deep child poverty | 5.1% (3.6 million) |
| Near-poor children | 15 million (21%) |
| Low-income children | 26.6 million (37%) |

## Child Poverty by Demographic

### By Age

| Age Group | Poverty Rate | Number in Poverty |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Under 3 | 18.8% | 2.1 million |
| 3-5 | 17.6% | 2.0 million |
| 6-11 | 15.8% | 3.8 million |
| 12-17 | 15.0% | 3.7 million |

**Young Children (0-5)**

- Highest poverty rates of any age group
- Most critical developmental period
- Brain architecture forming
- Damage most lasting, intervention most effective
- 4.1 million children under 6 in poverty

**Why Young Children Are Most Vulnerable**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Brain development | 90% of brain develops by age 5 |
| Toxic stress | Prolonged stress damages neural pathways |
| Language acquisition | Critical window for vocabulary |
| Executive function | Foundation for self-regulation |
| Attachment | Parent stress affects bonding |

### By Race and Ethnicity

| Group | Child Poverty Rate | Ratio to White Rate |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| White (non-Hispanic) | 10.5% | 1.0x |
| Black | 26.5% | 2.5x |
| Hispanic | 22.3% | 2.1x |
| Asian | 10.8% | 1.0x |
| Native American | 29.1% | 2.8x |
| Two or more races | 15.2% | 1.4x |

**Racial Disparities**

- Black children: More than 1 in 4 in poverty
- Hispanic children: More than 1 in 5 in poverty
- Native American children: Nearly 1 in 3 in poverty
- Gaps persist at every level of parental education
- Historical discrimination compounds effects

**By the Numbers**

| Group | Children in Poverty |
|-------|---------------------|
| White | 4.4 million |
| Hispanic | 4.0 million |
| Black | 2.7 million |
| Asian | 0.4 million |

| Female-headed, no spouse | 35.0% | 4.7x |
| Male-headed, no spouse | 18.3% | 2.4x |

**Single-Parent Family Poverty**

- Children in single-mother families: Nearly 5x poverty rate
- 8.7 million children in female-headed families live in poverty
- Single parenthood is risk factor, not destiny
- Policy can compensate (other countries do)

**Why Single-Parent Poverty Is High**

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| One earner | Less income potential |
| Childcare needs | More acute, expensive |
| Work constraints | Less flexibility |
| Time poverty | Cannot do it all |

|-------------------|-------------------|
| Less than high school | 35.6% |
| High school graduate | 21.8% |
| Some college | 14.3% |
| Bachelor's degree+ | 5.6% |

**Education-Poverty Connection**

- College-educated parents' children: 6x less likely poor
- But education cannot fully overcome structural factors
- Racial gaps persist at every education level
- Education alone cannot solve child poverty

### By Parental Employment

| Work Status of Parent(s) | Child Poverty Rate |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| All parents employed full-time | 4.8% |
| At least one parent employed | 12.3% |
| No parent employed | 54.2% |

**Working Poor Families with Children**

- 6.9 million children in working poor families
- Work does not guarantee escape from child poverty
- Low wages, part-time work, benefit gaps

- Approximately 700,000 children live in households with less than $2/day cash income
- Often disconnected from both work and welfare
- May have some in-kind benefits (SNAP, housing) but lack cash
- Represents failure of safety net to reach most vulnerable

## Material Hardship Among Children

### Food Insecurity

| Status | Households with Children |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Food secure | 82.4% |
| Food insecure | 17.6% (6.9 million households) |
| Very low food security | 7.4% (2.9 million households) |

**Food Insecurity Means**

- Not enough food
- Poor nutrition
- Hunger affecting concentration
- Long-term health effects

### Housing Instability

| Hardship | Prevalence Among Children |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Cost-burdened (>30% income) | 40% of renter families with children |
| Severely burdened (>50%) | 20% |
| Overcrowded conditions | 8% |
| Experiencing homelessness (annual) | 1+ million children |
| Doubled up with others | 7% |

**Homelessness**

- 1.3+ million students experienced homelessness (school year data)
- Point-in-time count underestimates family homelessness
- Often doubled up or in motels
- Devastating for development and education

### Healthcare Access

| Issue | Children Affected |
|-------|-------------------|
| Uninsured | 3.7 million (5.0%) |
| Underinsured | Millions more |
| Delayed care due to cost | 4.5% of children |
| No usual source of care | 3.6% |

**Medicaid and CHIP Matter**

- 40+ million children covered by Medicaid/CHIP
- Uninsured rate would be triple without
- COVID unwinding increased uninsured
- Coverage gaps persist, especially for immigrant children

### Other Hardships

| Hardship | Prevalence |
|----------|------------|
| Utility shutoff or threat | 12% of households with children |
| No internet access | 5% of children |
| Unable to afford prescription | 4% of children |
| Inadequate heating/cooling | 10% |

## The 2021 Child Tax Credit Expansion

### What the Expansion Did

| Element | Prior CTC | 2021 Expanded CTC |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Maximum amount | $2,000 | $3,600 (under 6), $3,000 (6-17) |
| Refundability | Partial (up to $1,400) | Fully refundable |
| Earnings requirement | Phase-in at 15% of earnings | None (fully refundable from $0) |
| Delivery | Annual tax refund | Monthly advance payments |
| Children reached | ~65 million | ~61 million |

### Impact on Child Poverty

**Before and After**

| Metric | 2020 | 2021 (Expanded) | 2022 (Expired) |
|--------|------|-----------------|----------------|
| SPM child poverty | 9.7% | 5.2% | 12.4% |
| Children in poverty | 7.0 million | 3.8 million | 9.0 million |
| Reduction | - | 46% | - |

**Children Lifted Out**

- 3.7 million children lifted out of poverty
- Largest single-year reduction in child poverty in history
- Reached poorest children for first time
- Monthly payments provided stability

### Who Benefited

| Group | SPM Poverty Reduction |
|-------|----------------------|
| All children | 46% |
| Black children | 52% |
| Hispanic children | 45% |
| Children under 6 | 50% |
| Deep poverty | 40% reduction |

### What Families Did with the Money

Research found families spent expanded CTC on:

| Spending Category | Share of Households |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Food | 70% |
| Utilities | 47% |
| Rent/mortgage | 36% |
| Clothing for children | 34% |
| Education expenses | 28% |
| Savings | 27% |

### Work Effects

**Did the Expansion Reduce Work?**

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Ananat et al. (2022) | No reduction in employment |
| Parolin et al. (2022) | No significant work effects |
| Hamilton et al. (2022) | Small increase in some groups |
| Goldin et al. (2022) | No effect on labor supply |

**Conclusion**: The expanded CTC did not reduce work. Fears of work disincentive were not borne out.

### What Expiration Showed

**January 2022: Payments Stopped**

| Outcome | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Child poverty | Immediately spiked |
| Monthly income | Dropped for 35+ million families |
| Food hardship | Increased significantly |
| Material hardship | Rose across measures |

The speed of the rebound demonstrated that expanded CTC was directly responsible for poverty reduction.

## Current Child Tax Credit

### Post-Expiration Structure (2022-Present)

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Maximum credit | $2,000/child |
| Refundable portion | Up to $1,700 (2024) |
| Phase-in | 15% of earnings above $2,500 |
| Phase-out starts | $200,000 (single), $400,000 (married) |
| Who misses out | Poorest children with low/no parental earnings |

### The Refundability Gap

**Why Partial Refundability Hurts Poorest Children**

| Family Earnings | CTC Benefit |
|-----------------|-------------|
| $0 | $0 |
| $10,000 | $1,125 |
| $20,000 | $2,000 |
| $30,000 | $2,000 |

Children in deepest poverty--whose parents have no or low earnings--receive the smallest or no benefit.

**Who Is Left Out**

- 19 million children receive less than full credit
- Primarily children in deepest poverty
- Disproportionately Black and Hispanic children
- Children whose parents are caregivers, disabled, students
