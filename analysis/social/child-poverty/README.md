# Child Poverty: Overview

One in six American children lives in poverty--11.6 million children in the wealthiest nation on earth. The United States has among the highest child poverty rates of any developed country, with rates 2-3 times higher than peer nations. This is not inevitable: the 2021 Child Tax Credit expansion proved that bold policy can cut child poverty nearly in half, reducing the rate from 9.7% to 5.2% under the Supplemental Poverty Measure. When the expansion expired, child poverty immediately spiked to 12.4%, demonstrating that child poverty in America is fundamentally a policy choice.
