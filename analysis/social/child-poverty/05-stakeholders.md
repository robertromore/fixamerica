### The Potential Coalition for CTC Expansion

**Bipartisan Interest (2024)**

| Party | Interest | Obstacle |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Democrats | Full expansion | Republican opposition |
| Some Republicans | Expansion with work requirement | Work requirement unacceptable to many |
| Business groups | Support for working families | Prefer tied to work |

**Path to Coalition**

- Compromise on amount
- Possible deal on work requirements (with protections)
- Business support for stability

## Strategic Implications

### Advantages for Action

1. **Moral clarity**: Children bear no responsibility for poverty
2. **Evidence base**: 2021 CTC proved what works
3. **Bipartisan potential**: Both parties say they care about children
4. **Return on investment**: Massive economic returns
5. **Public support**: Overwhelming support for helping poor children

### Challenges for Action

1. **Children can't vote**: No direct political voice
2. **Cost concerns**: Real (though overstated)
3. **Work requirement divide**: Fundamental disagreement
4. **Racial politics**: Racialization of poverty
5. **Stigma**: "Welfare" framing harms support

### Building Power for Children

**Short-Term**

- Support CTC expansion campaigns
- Elect child poverty champions
- State-level victories
- Public education on 2021 impact

**Long-Term**

- Build universal programs (broader coalition)
- Organize parents and communities
- Change narrative around poverty
- Deracialize poverty discourse
