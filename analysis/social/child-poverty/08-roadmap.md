# Child Poverty: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Overview

Reducing child poverty requires sustained effort across multiple fronts. This roadmap sequences reforms based on political feasibility, evidence, and maximum impact for children. The 2021 CTC expansion proved that dramatic progress is possible; the challenge is making it permanent and building broader support.

## Guiding Principles

### Sequencing Logic

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Children first** | Every delay means more children harmed |
| **Proven solutions** | Prioritize what we know works (CTC) |
| **Build momentum** | Early wins create support for more |
| **Universal elements** | Broader support for universal programs |
| **Durability** | Design for permanence, not expiration |

### Political Strategy

| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Framing** | Investment in children, tax cut for families |
| **Coalition** | Parents, business, faith, bipartisan |
| **Evidence** | 2021 CTC success central |

| **Narrative** | Children are innocent; poverty is a choice |
