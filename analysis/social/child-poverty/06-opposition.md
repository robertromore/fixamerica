# Child Poverty: Opposition to Reform

## The Opposition Landscape

Opposition to child poverty reduction efforts comes from multiple sources with different motivations. Some genuinely believe work requirements protect children's interests. Others have ideological opposition to redistribution. Still others use anti-poverty politics for electoral advantage. Understanding these forces is essential for developing effective strategies.

## Economic Interests Against Reform

### Anti-Tax Interests

**Who They Are**

- Wealthy individuals and families
- Corporations seeking low taxes
- Business associations
- Anti-tax advocacy groups

**What They Oppose**

| Policy | Opposition Level |
|--------|------------------|
| Expanded CTC (costs revenue) | High |
| New taxes to fund child benefits | Very High |
| Wealth tax | Very High |
| Corporate tax increases | Very High |

**Why They Oppose**

- CTC expansion costs ~$100 billion/year
- Would require revenue or deficit
- Oppose any expansion of social spending
- Zero-sum view of taxation

### Low-Wage Employers (Indirect)

**Less Direct Opposition, But Related**

| Interest | Connection |
|----------|------------|
| Minimum wage | Higher wages reduce child poverty |
| Benefits mandates | Shift costs to employers |
| Scheduling laws | Reduce flexibility |
| Paid leave | Employer costs |

**Their Argument**

- Child poverty should be addressed through tax credits, not employer mandates
- Prefer public subsidy of low wages (EITC model)
- Some actually support CTC because it subsidizes their workers

## Ideological Opposition

### Conservative Think Tanks

**Major Organizations**

| Organization | Position on Child Poverty |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| Heritage Foundation | Work requirements essential; oppose full refundability |
| American Enterprise Institute | Mixed; some support CTC expansion |
| Cato Institute | Prefer cash over programs; some openness |
| Foundation for Government Accountability | Work requirements, time limits |
| Manhattan Institute | Cultural/behavioral explanations |

**Key Arguments**

1. **Work incentives**: Full refundability reduces work incentive
2. **Dependency**: Unconditional benefits create dependency
3. **Marriage**: Focus on family structure over income
4. **Inefficiency**: Government programs wasteful
5. **Crowd-out**: Government replaces private support

### "Culture of Poverty" Arguments

**The Narrative**

- Child poverty caused by parental behavior
- Family structure (single parenthood) primary cause
- Marriage is the solution
- Benefits enable irresponsibility
- Focus on behavior change, not income

**Problems with This View**

| Claim | Counter-Evidence |
|-------|------------------|
| Family structure is primary | Other countries have low child poverty for all family types |
| Marriage is solution | Cannot be forced; poverty causes instability too |
| Benefits cause poverty | 2021 CTC expansion reduced poverty without effects on work/marriage |
| It's about values | Same "values," different outcomes by race/place |

### Work-Requirement Ideology

**The Position**

- No benefit without work
- Work is best anti-poverty program
- Must incentivize work
- "No something for nothing"

**Variants**

| Variant | Position |
|---------|----------|
| Strict | No CTC without earnings |
| Moderate | Phase-in acceptable; some floor for all |
| Pragmatic | Work incentive through EITC; CTC can be unconditional |

**Problems with Work Requirements for Children**

| Issue | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Children can't work | Why punish for parents' status? |
| Most parents work | 70% of poor children have working parent |
| Barriers exist | Health, disability, caregiving |
| 2021 showed no effect | No work reduction from full refundability |

## Political Opposition

### Republican Party (Divided)

**Official Positions Vary**

| Position | Proponents |
|----------|------------|
| Oppose expansion | Freedom Caucus, fiscal conservatives |
| Support with work requirements | Rubio-Lee approach |
| Support child allowance | Romney proposal |
| Oppose as "welfare" | Traditional opposition |

**The Divide**

- Pro-family wing: Some support child benefits
- Fiscal conservatives: Oppose spending
- Work-requirement absolutists: Nothing unconditional
- Cultural conservatives: Focus on marriage

### Congressional Opposition

**Specific Obstacles**

| Obstacle | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Filibuster | 60 votes needed in Senate |
| House Republican majority | No expansion without compromise |
| Work requirement demand | Dealbreaker for some Democrats |
| Deficit concerns | Used to block spending |

**Key Opposition Figures**

- Many House Republicans
- Some Senate Republicans
- Fiscal conservative Democrats (on cost)

### State-Level Opposition

**Actions by Restrictive States**

| Action | Effect on Children |
|--------|-------------------|
| Low TANF benefits | Inadequate cash support |
| Strict TANF rules | Fewer families served |
| No Medicaid expansion | Children's parents uninsured |
| No state CTC | Children miss out |
| Strict SNAP | Food insecurity |

## Arguments Against Child Poverty Reduction

### "Work Incentives" Argument

**The Claim**

- Full CTC refundability reduces parental work
- Must maintain work incentive
- Phase-in ensures work connection

**Evidence**

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| 2021 CTC research | No reduction in employment |
| Multiple academic studies | No work effects found |
| International evidence | High-benefit countries have high work rates |
| EITC research | Work incentive at margin; but not everyone can work |

**Counter-Argument**

- 2021 expansion showed no work reduction
- Most poor parents already work
- Some parents cannot work (disability, caregiving)
- Children should not be punished for parents' circumstances

### "Fiscal Responsibility" Argument

**The Claim**

- Cannot afford CTC expansion
- Deficit concerns paramount
- Must prioritize spending

**Reality**

| Consideration | Assessment |
|---------------|------------|
| CTC expansion cost | ~$100 billion/year |
| 2017 tax cuts | $1.9 trillion over 10 years |
| Defense budget | $850+ billion/year |
| Cost of child poverty | $1 trillion/year |
| Return on investment | 7:1 or higher |

**Counter-Argument**

- Resources exist; question is priorities
- Child poverty reduction saves money long-term
- Tax expenditures for wealthy rarely scrutinized
- Investment, not cost

### "Marriage/Family Structure" Argument

**The Claim**

- Child poverty is fundamentally about family structure
- Single parenthood is the cause
- Promote marriage instead of benefits

**Evidence**

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| International comparison | Other countries have low poverty for all family types |
| Policy effectiveness | Marriage promotion programs haven't worked |
| Causation | Poverty causes family instability too |
| Rights | Cannot force marriage; respect diverse families |

**Counter-Argument**

- Family structure matters, but policy can compensate
- Other countries prove single-parent poverty not inevitable
- Marriage cannot be legislated
- Children should not be punished for family type

### "Dependency" Argument

**The Claim**

- Benefits create dependency
- Multi-generational welfare use
- Must break cycle

**Evidence**

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| TANF research | Caseload decline didn't reduce poverty |
| CTC 2021 | No evidence of dependency |
| International | High-benefit countries have high employment |
| Historical | AFDC didn't create dependency; was response |

**Counter-Argument**

- "Dependency" is framing, not evidence
- Children depend on adults by nature
- Benefits enable stability, not dependency
- The alternative (poverty) creates real dependence

## Opposition Tactics

### Messaging and Framing

**Dominant Narratives**

| Narrative | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| "Welfare expansion" | Stigmatize CTC |
| "Paying people not to work" | Work incentive frame |
| "Irresponsible parents" | Blame families |
| "Can't afford" | Fiscal barrier |
| "Government handout" | Delegitimize support |

**Reframing Attempts**

| Opposition Frame | Reframe |
|------------------|---------|
| Welfare | Tax cut for families |
| Handout | Investment in children |
| Paying not to work | Supporting all children |
| Dependency | Opportunity |

### Legislative Tactics

| Tactic | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Work requirement demands | Make CTC contingent on earnings |
| Filibuster | Block Senate consideration |
| Pay-for requirements | Demand offsets |
| Bundling | Include with unpopular provisions |
| Delay | Run out clock |

### "Poison Pill" Amendments

**Work Requirement as Poison Pill**

Some work requirement proposals are designed to:
- Kill bipartisan deals
- Make bill unacceptable to Democrats
- Avoid blame for opposition

### Administrative Obstruction

**If Legislation Passes**

| Tactic | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Complex implementation | Reduce uptake |
| Verification requirements | Burden families |
| Outreach limitations | Fewer families reached |
| Technology failures | Payments delayed |

## Recent Opposition Campaigns

### Against CTC Expansion (2021-2024)

**Opposition Arguments**

| Argument | Reality |
|----------|---------|
| "Work disincentive" | No work reduction found |
| "Too expensive" | Less than 2017 tax cuts |
| "Not targeted" | Reached poorest children |
| "Fraud risk" | No significant fraud found |
| "Monthly payments too complex" | IRS delivered successfully |

**Result**: Expansion expired December 2021; child poverty doubled.

### Against Build Back Better (2021-2022)

**Opposition**

- Senator Manchin's objections (work requirements, cost)
- Republican unified opposition
- Some fiscal concerns from moderate Democrats

**What Was Lost**

- Permanent CTC expansion
- Universal Pre-K
- Childcare investments
- Paid leave

### 2024 CTC Negotiations

**Opposition to Bipartisan Deal**

- Some Republicans wanted more restrictive work requirements
- Some Democrats wouldn't accept any work requirements
- Deal collapsed in Senate (blocked by Republicans)

## Weaknesses of the Opposition

### Evidence Not on Their Side

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| CTC reduces work | No effect found in 2021 |
| Child poverty is about behavior | Structural causes clear |
| Benefits create dependency | No evidence |
| Can't afford solutions | Spending priorities, not constraint |
| Marriage is solution | Can't be mandated; policy can help all families |

### Public Opinion Favors Action

| Issue | Public Support |
|-------|----------------|
| Expanded CTC | 60%+ |
| Help poor children | 80%+ |
| Government should ensure no child poverty | 70%+ |
| Work requirements | More divided |

### Some Business Support

- Childcare investments help employers
- Stability helps workers
- Consumer demand requires income
- Some companies support CTC expansion

### Bipartisan Champions Exist

| Champion | Position |
|----------|----------|
| Senator Romney | Proposed child allowance |
| Senator Rubio | Supports CTC expansion (with modifications) |
| Some House Republicans | Open to compromise |

### The 2021 Evidence

**What the Expansion Proved**

| Claim | 2021 Result |
|-------|-------------|
| Can't reduce child poverty | Cut it nearly in half |
| Will reduce work | No work reduction |
| Administratively impossible | Monthly payments worked |
| Will be abused | No significant fraud |

## Divisions Within Opposition

### Pro-Family vs. Fiscal Conservatives

| Group | Position |
|-------|----------|
| Pro-family conservatives | May support child benefits |
| Fiscal conservatives | Oppose spending |
| Tension | How to be pro-family without spending |

### Work Requirement Spectrum

| Position | Adherents |
|----------|-----------|
| Strict (no refundability without work) | Heritage, FGA |
| Moderate (some floor acceptable) | Some Republicans |
| Pragmatic (EITC for work, CTC for children) | Romney |

### Donor Class vs. Voters

| Group | Position |
|-------|----------|
| Wealthy donors | Oppose tax increases |
| Republican voters | Some support for family benefits |
| Tension | Donors fund politicians; voters elect them |

## Strategic Implications

### Understanding Motivation Matters

| Opponent Type | Approach |
|---------------|----------|
| Fiscal conservatives | Show ROI, long-term savings |
| Work requirement advocates | Evidence of no work effects; protect children |
| Cultural conservatives | Reach through faith, family values |
| Anti-tax | Find non-tax revenue; phase in |

### Potential for Compromise

**Areas of Possible Agreement**

| Element | Potential |
|---------|-----------|
| Higher CTC amount | Some agreement possible |
| Expanded refundability | Possible with safeguards |
| Monthly payments | Technical agreement |
| Work requirement | Most contentious; possible compromise? |

**The Work Requirement Question**

- Some Republicans require work connection
- Some Democrats will accept none
- Middle ground: Work incentive through EITC; unconditional floor for children

### Where Progress Is Possible

**Federal**

- CTC expansion in bipartisan deal
- Childcare investments
- Pre-K expansion

**State**

- State CTCs (15+ states have enacted)
- State EITC expansion
- Minimum wage increases
- Childcare investments
