# Child Poverty: Solutions

## Overview

Child poverty in America is a policy choice. The 2021 Child Tax Credit expansion proved that bold action can cut child poverty nearly in half. Other wealthy nations achieve child poverty rates 2-4 times lower than ours through universal child benefits, paid leave, affordable childcare, and living wages. The solutions exist; the question is whether we choose to implement them.

## Framework for Solutions

### What We Know Works

| Solution | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Direct cash to families | 2021 CTC cut child poverty 46% |
| Universal child benefits | Canada, UK, Germany have lower rates |
| Affordable childcare | Enables work, reduces costs |
| Higher wages | Lifts working families |
| Healthcare access | Reduces medical poverty |

## Direct Income Solutions

### Permanent Child Tax Credit Expansion

**The Proven Solution**

| Element | Recommended |
|---------|-------------|
| Amount | $3,600/child under 6; $3,000/child 6-17 |
| Refundability | Fully refundable (reaches all children) |
| Earnings requirement | None (unconditional) |
| Delivery | Monthly advance payments |
| Phase-out | Begins at $150,000 (single), $200,000 (married) |
| Indexing | Annual adjustment for inflation |

**Impact**

- Would lift 3-4 million children out of poverty
- Would cut child poverty rate by 40-50%
- Would reach poorest children for first time
- Would provide monthly income stability

**Why This Design**

| Feature | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Full refundability | Poorest children need most help |
| No earnings requirement | Children shouldn't be punished for parents' work status |
| Monthly payments | Income stability better than annual lump sum |
| Higher for young children | Childcare costs highest; development most critical |

### Universal Child Allowance

**Beyond CTC: A True Child Benefit**

| Element | Design |
|---------|--------|
| Amount | $400-500/month per child |
| Universality | All children; tax back at high incomes |

## International Lessons

### What Other Countries Do

| Country | Child Poverty | Key Policies |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Denmark | 3.7% | Universal benefits, universal childcare, paid leave |
| Finland | 3.5% | Child allowance, comprehensive services |
| Germany | 8.0% | Kindergeld, paid leave, affordable care |
| Canada | 8.1% | Canada Child Benefit (reformed 2016) |
| UK | 11.0% | Child Benefit, tax credits |

### Key Lessons

1. **Universal beats targeted**: Universal programs have stronger support, better take-up
2. **Cash works**: Direct payments reduce poverty simply
3. **Services complement**: Childcare, healthcare reduce costs
4. **Combination matters**: No single policy solves everything
5. **Political will is key**: Other countries chose lower poverty
