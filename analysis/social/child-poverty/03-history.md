# Child Poverty: History

## Early American Attitudes Toward Poor Children

### Colonial Period to Early Republic

**Children as Property/Labor**

- Children seen primarily as economic assets
- Child labor widespread and expected
- Orphans "bound out" to work
- Minimal distinction between child and adult poverty
- Local poor relief applied to families

**Key Features**

| Era | Approach to Poor Children |
|-----|--------------------------|
| Colonial | Indenture, poorhouses, family responsibility |
| Early Republic | Orphanages, almshouses, child labor |
| Antebellum | Reform movements begin, "child saving" |

### 19th Century

**Industrial Child Labor**

- Factory work for children as young as 5
- Mining, textile mills, agriculture
- 1870: 1 in 8 children aged 10-15 employed
- 1900: 2 million children working
- Poverty wages, dangerous conditions

**Reform Movements**

| Movement | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| Child saving | Remove children from "unfit" homes |
| Settlement houses | Community services for poor families |
| Compulsory education | Keep children in school, out of factories |
| Juvenile courts | Separate system for children |

**Problems with Early Reform**

- Class and race bias
- Removed children from immigrant/poor families
- Institutionalization over family support
- Did not address poverty itself

## Progressive Era (1890-1920)

### The Discovery of Child Poverty

**New Recognition**

- Photography documented conditions (Lewis Hine, Jacob Riis)
- Research quantified child labor, poverty
- Recognition that poverty harmed children's development
- Shift toward supporting families rather than removing children

**Key Developments**

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1899 | First juvenile court (Illinois) |
| 1909 | White House Conference on Children |
| 1911 | First mothers' pension law (Illinois) |
| 1912 | Children's Bureau established |
| 1916 | First federal child labor law (struck down) |

### Mothers' Pensions

**A New Approach: Support Families**

- Cash grants to widowed mothers
- Keep children with families rather than institutions
- 40 states had programs by 1920
- Precursor to AFDC/TANF

**Limitations**

| Limitation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Only widows (mostly) | Excluded divorced, unmarried |
| Racial exclusion | Black families systematically denied |
| Low benefits | Inadequate for subsistence |
| Moral scrutiny | "Suitable home" requirements |
| Limited funding | Many eligible not served |

### Children's Bureau (1912)

- First federal agency focused on children
- Researched infant mortality, child labor
- Advocated for children's welfare
- Still exists within HHS

## New Deal Era (1933-1945)

### The Great Depression's Impact on Children

**Childhood Devastated**

- Family incomes collapsed
- Malnutrition widespread
- Education interrupted
- Child labor increased (desperation)
- Child poverty perhaps 50%+

### Aid to Dependent Children (1935)

**The Social Security Act Created ADC**

| Element | Design |
|---------|--------|
| Purpose | Cash aid to children deprived of parental support |
| Administration | State-run with federal funding |
| Coverage | Initially children only (not caretaker) |
| Benefits | Set by states |

**How ADC Worked**

- Federal matching grants to states
- States set eligibility and benefits
- "Suitable home" provisions
- Subject to state discretion and discrimination

**Racial Exclusion by Design**

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Agricultural exclusion | Excluded most Black workers from Social Security |
| Domestic worker exclusion | Excluded Black women |
| State administration | Enabled discrimination |
| "Suitable home" rules | Used to deny Black families |
| Benefit levels | Lower in South |

### Other New Deal Child Programs

| Program | Benefit to Children |
|---------|---------------------|
| WPA nurseries | Childcare for working mothers |
| School lunch programs | Nutrition |
| CCC | Youth employment |
| NYA | Youth training |

## Post-War Era (1945-1964)

### Expansion of ADC

**Growth**

| Year | ADC Recipients |
|------|----------------|
| 1940 | 1.2 million |
| 1950 | 2.2 million |
| 1960 | 3.1 million |

**Key Changes**

- 1950: Caretaker added to grant (AFDC)
- Caseloads grew with migration to cities
- Benefits remained low
- Racial disparities continued

### The "Welfare Queen" Myth Emerges

- 1950s: Attacks on "illegitimacy" and ADC
- "Man in the house" rules
- Midnight raids to check compliance
- Racial and gender stereotypes weaponized
- Laid groundwork for later backlash

### Child Poverty Rates (Pre-War on Poverty)

| Year | Child Poverty Rate |
|------|-------------------|
| 1959 | 27.3% |
| 1963 | 23.1% |

More than 1 in 4 children poor as late as 1959.

## War on Poverty Era (1964-1980)

### The Rediscovery of Child Poverty

**"The Other America" (1962)**

- Michael Harrington's book spotlighted poverty
- Children among the "invisible poor"
- Influenced Kennedy and Johnson administrations
- Sparked policy response

### Head Start (1965)

**A Focus on Early Childhood**

| Element | Design |
|---------|--------|
| Target | Low-income preschoolers |
| Services | Education, health, nutrition, parent involvement |
| Model | Comprehensive child development |
| Administration | Community-based |
| Reach today | ~1 million children annually |

**Impact**

- Improved school readiness
- Health benefits
- Long-term educational gains
- But: Never funded to reach all eligible

### Child Nutrition Programs

| Program | Year | Children Served Today |
|---------|------|----------------------|
| National School Lunch | 1946 (expanded 1960s) | 30+ million |
| School Breakfast | 1966 | 15+ million |
| Summer Meals | 1968 | 2+ million |
| WIC | 1972 | 6+ million |

### Medicaid (1965)

- Health coverage for AFDC recipients
- Eventually covered millions of children
- Now: 40+ million children on Medicaid/CHIP
- Major child poverty reducer (medical costs)

### Child Poverty Decline

| Year | Child Poverty Rate |
|------|-------------------|
| 1959 | 27.3% |
| 1966 | 17.6% |
| 1970 | 15.1% |
| 1975 | 17.1% |

War on Poverty cut child poverty significantly, though never eliminated it.

### Nixon Era: Guaranteed Income Nearly Passes

**Family Assistance Plan (FAP)**

- Nixon proposed guaranteed income for families
- Would have provided floor for all families with children
- Passed House twice
- Failed in Senate
- Conservative opposition: too generous
- Liberal opposition: not generous enough

**What Passed Instead**

- SSI (1972): Disabled and elderly
- EITC (1975): Tax credit for working families
- Food Stamp expansion

## Conservative Retrenchment (1980-1996)

### Reagan Era

**Attacking "Welfare"**

- "Welfare queen" narrative popularized
- Racially coded attacks on AFDC
- Budget cuts to programs
- Tightened eligibility
- "Dependency" narrative

**Child Poverty Under Reagan**

| Year | Child Poverty Rate |
|------|-------------------|
| 1980 | 18.3% |
| 1983 | 22.3% |
| 1989 | 19.6% |

Child poverty spiked during 1981-1982 recession and recovered slowly.

### Growing Focus on Work

**1988 Family Support Act**

- JOBS program: work and training requirements
- Transitional benefits (childcare, Medicaid)
- Child support enforcement
- Work focus, but still within AFDC structure

### State Experimentation

- Waivers allowed state "experiments"
- Time limits tested
- Work requirements tightened
- Benefit cuts
- Laid groundwork for 1996 reform

## Welfare Reform (1996)

### Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act

**Fundamental Change**

| Before (AFDC) | After (TANF) |
|---------------|--------------|
| Entitlement | Block grant |
| Open-ended funding | Fixed funding |
| No time limit | 5-year lifetime limit |
| Work optional | Work required |
| Federal standards | State flexibility |

**Impact on Children**

| Metric | 1996 | 2000 | 2020 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Families receiving cash aid | 4.4 million | 2.2 million | 1.0 million |
| Share of poor families served | 68% | 52% | 21% |

### Immediate Effects

**What Happened to Children**

| Outcome | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Caseloads | Dropped 60% in first 5 years |
| Child poverty (overall) | Declined initially (strong economy) |
| Deep child poverty | Did not decline; later increased |
| Extreme poverty | Increased |
| Material hardship | Persisted |

**The Good Economy Masked Problems**

- 1990s boom created jobs
- EITC expansion helped working families
- Initial decline attributed to reform was largely economy
- When recession hit, TANF didn't respond

### Long-Term Consequences

**TANF's Failure for Children**

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Block grant frozen | Lost 40% of value to inflation |
| Caseload collapse | Only 21% of poor families served |
| Time limits | Families lose aid regardless of need |
| Work requirements | Sanctions cut off aid |
| State diversion | Only 24% spent on cash assistance |

## The EITC/CTC Era (1993-2020)

### Earned Income Tax Credit Expansion

**Growth of EITC**

| Year | Maximum Credit (Family with Children) |
|------|---------------------------------------|
| 1975 | $400 |
| 1990 | $953 |
| 1996 | $3,556 |
| 2000 | $3,888 |
| 2020 | $6,660 |

**Impact on Child Poverty**

- EITC became largest cash anti-poverty program for families
- Work-conditioned: required earnings
- Lifted millions of children out of poverty
- But: Did not reach children of non-working parents

### Child Tax Credit History

**CTC Created (1997)**

| Year | Amount | Refundability |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 1997 | $400 | Non-refundable |
| 1998 | $500 | Non-refundable |
| 2001 | $600 | Partially refundable |
| 2003 | $1,000 | Partially refundable |
| 2018 | $2,000 | Partially refundable ($1,400) |

**Fundamental Limitation**

The CTC's design--requiring earnings for full credit--excluded the poorest children whose parents had little or no earnings.

### Child Poverty Trends (1996-2020)

| Year | Child Poverty Rate |
|------|-------------------|
| 1996 | 20.5% |
| 2000 | 16.2% |
| 2010 | 22.0% |
| 2015 | 19.7% |
| 2019 | 14.4% |

Child poverty remained high, fluctuating with economy rather than steadily declining.

## The 2021 Transformation

### American Rescue Plan Child Tax Credit

**What Changed**

| Element | Before | 2021 Expansion |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Amount | $2,000 | $3,600/$3,000 |
| Refundability | Partial ($1,400) | Full |
| Earnings requirement | Yes (phase-in) | No |
| Delivery | Annual | Monthly payments |
| Children reached | Partial | Nearly all |

### Historic Impact

**Child Poverty Results**

| Metric | 2020 | 2021 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| SPM child poverty | 9.7% | 5.2% | -46% |
| Children in poverty | 7.0 million | 3.8 million | -3.2 million |
| Deep child poverty | Significant | Reduced | -40% |

**Historic Achievement**

- Largest single-year reduction in child poverty ever
- Reached poorest children for first time
- Monthly payments provided stability
- Proved child poverty could be dramatically reduced

### Expiration and Aftermath

**December 2021: Expansion Expires**

| What Happened | Result |
|---------------|--------|
| Monthly payments stopped | 35+ million families lost income |
| Credit reverted | Back to $2,000, partial refundability |
| Child poverty | Spiked from 5.2% to 12.4% |
| Children back in poverty | 5+ million |

**Demonstrated**

- Expanded CTC directly caused poverty reduction
- Without it, poverty immediately returned
- Child poverty is fundamentally a policy choice

## Lessons from History

### What Has Reduced Child Poverty

| Policy/Factor | Evidence |
|---------------|----------|
| Economic growth (with shared gains) | Pre-1980 prosperity |
| Direct income support | 2021 CTC expansion |
| Tax credits (EITC) | Lifted millions |
| Social insurance | Social Security for survivors |
| In-kind benefits | SNAP, Medicaid, housing |

### What Has Increased Child Poverty

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Economic recessions | 1981-82, 2008-09, 2020 |
| Policy retrenchment | 1980s cuts, 1996 welfare reform |
| Benefit expiration | 2022 CTC reversion |
| Block grants | TANF erosion |
| Work requirements | Exclude non-workers |

### Persistent Patterns

1. **Racial exclusion**: From mothers' pensions to TANF, racial discrimination
2. **Work conditionality**: Consistent requirement for "deserving" status
3. **Deserving/undeserving**: Children often caught in parents' categorization
4. **State variation**: Creates geographic inequality
5. **Political fragility**: Gains reversed by political change
6. **Benefit inadequacy**: Programs rarely lift families out of poverty alone

### The Counterfactual: What Other Countries Did

While U.S. moved toward work requirements and time limits:

| Country | Approach | Result |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Canada | Universal child benefit (2016) | Child poverty cut by 1/3 |
| UK | Universal child benefit (expanded) | Lower than U.S. |
| Nordic countries | Universal benefits, services | 3-5% child poverty |
| Germany | Kindergeld (child money) | 8% child poverty |

**Key Difference**: Other countries provide universal child benefits; U.S. conditions support on parental work.
