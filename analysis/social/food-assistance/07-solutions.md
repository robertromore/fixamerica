# Food Assistance: Solutions

## Reform Framework

### Principles

- **Universal access**: Move toward systems where all who need assistance can receive it without bureaucratic barriers
- **Benefit adequacy**: Benefits must provide actual food security throughout the month
- **Dignity and choice**: Programs should respect recipient autonomy and minimize stigma
- **Simplification**: Reduce complexity through program integration and streamlined administration
- **Prevention focus**: Invest in preventing food insecurity, not just responding to it
- **Health integration**: Connect nutrition assistance with health outcomes and healthcare systems

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: SNAP Benefit Adequacy

**Description**: Increase SNAP benefits to levels that actually provide food security throughout the month.

**Components**:

1. **Modernize the Thrifty Food Plan**
    - Base on realistic time for food preparation (30 minutes, not 2+ hours)
    - Account for actual food costs in participant communities
    - Include real-world food waste rates
    - Adjust for different household compositions

2. **Increase minimum benefit**
    - Raise minimum from $23 to $100/month
    - Ensure benefits cover actual need
    - Index to food price inflation

3. **Regional cost adjustment**
    - Adjust benefits for geographic variation in food costs
    - Higher benefits in high-cost areas
    - Account for food desert premium

4. **Summer benefit enhancement**
    - Permanent Summer EBT for all children
    - Bridge gap when school meals unavailable
    - Automatic enrollment for school meal participants

**Evidence**: The 2021 Thrifty Food Plan update demonstrated that benefit increases are administratively feasible and significantly reduce food insecurity.

**Challenges**: Cost (estimated $20-30 billion annually for full adequacy). Political resistance to "increasing welfare."

### Solution 2: Universal School Meals

**Description**: Provide free breakfast and lunch to all students regardless of family income.

**Components**:

1. **Eliminate income eligibility**
    - Free meals for all students K-12
    - No applications, no income verification
    - Universal participation removes stigma

2. **Expand Community Eligibility Provision**
    - Lower threshold from 40% to 25% identified students
    - Allow district-wide and state-wide CEP
    - Increase reimbursement rates

3. **Improve meal quality**
    - Increase per-meal reimbursement
    - Support local food procurement
    - Enhance nutrition standards
    - Address food allergies and dietary needs

4. **Extend to all meals and snacks**
    - Universal breakfast (currently lower participation)
    - Afterschool snacks
    - Summer meals integration

**Evidence**: States with universal meals (California, Maine, Minnesota, Colorado) show increased participation, reduced stigma, and improved academic outcomes.

**Challenges**: Cost (estimated $10-15 billion annually federal). Industry opposition to nutrition standards.

### Solution 3: Streamlined Access

**Description**: Remove administrative barriers that prevent eligible people from receiving benefits.

**Components**:

1. **Automatic enrollment**
    - Use tax data to identify likely-eligible households
    - Pre-populate applications
    - Opt-out rather than opt-in enrollment
    - Cross-enrollment across programs

2. **Continuous eligibility**
    - 24-month certification periods (from current 6-12)
    - Simplified recertification process
    - End procedural disenrollment

3. **Integrated applications**
    - Single application for SNAP, WIC, school meals, Medicaid
    - Express lane eligibility across programs
    - Online and mobile-first applications

4. **Eliminate documentation burdens**
    - Self-attestation where possible
    - Electronic verification from existing databases
    - Presumptive eligibility while verification pending

**Evidence**: States with simplified procedures have higher participation rates. Express lane eligibility increases enrollment without increasing error rates.

**Challenges**: State agency capacity. IT system integration. Political resistance to "loosening" requirements.

### Solution 4: Expand Eligibility

**Description**: Close gaps in coverage that leave vulnerable populations without assistance.

**Components**:

1. **Eliminate ABAWD time limits**
    - End 3-month limit for childless adults
    - Remove work reporting requirements
    - Focus resources on voluntary E&T programs

2. **Expand college student access**
    - Remove work hour requirements for students
    - Allow SNAP for meal plan-ineligible students
    - Integrate with campus food programs

3. **Restore immigrant eligibility**
    - End 5-year waiting period for legal immigrants
    - Provide state-funded benefits for undocumented residents
    - End "public charge" chilling effects

4. **Raise income limits**
    - Increase gross income limit to 200% FPL
    - Eliminate asset tests entirely
    - Expand categorical eligibility

**Evidence**: Work requirements don't increase employment. Immigrant restrictions harm U.S. citizen children. Asset tests create poverty traps.

**Challenges**: Political resistance to expanding "welfare." Cost of expanded eligibility.

### Solution 5: Senior Nutrition Expansion

**Description**: Ensure no senior faces hunger through expanded home-delivered and congregate meals.

**Components**:

1. **Eliminate Meals on Wheels waitlists**
    - Fully fund demand for home-delivered meals
    - Expand weekend and holiday meals
    - Include nutrition supplements and modified diets

2. **Expand congregate meal sites**
    - Increase senior center funding
    - Partner with community organizations
    - Address transportation barriers

3. **Senior SNAP modernization**
    - Simplified application for seniors
    - Standard medical expense deduction
    - Higher minimum benefit
    - Automatic enrollment via Social Security

4. **SNAP/senior program integration**
    - Combined eligibility determination
    - Seamless transitions between programs
    - Coordinated nutrition services

**Evidence**: 83% of Meals on Wheels programs have waitlists despite proven effectiveness at reducing healthcare costs and improving independence.

**Challenges**: Funding (Older Americans Act underfunded). Coordination across aging and nutrition programs.

### Solution 6: Strengthen Emergency Food Network

**Description**: Support food banks while maintaining primacy of federal nutrition programs.

**Components**:

1. **Increase TEFAP funding**
    - Expand federal commodity purchases
    - Improve distribution efficiency
    - Support food bank infrastructure

2. **Food bank-SNAP integration**
    - Offer SNAP application assistance at food banks
    - Refer food bank clients to benefits
    - Share data to identify underserved populations

3. **Improve food quality**
    - Nutrition standards for donated food
    - Support for fresh produce
    - Culturally appropriate foods

4. **Reduce reliance through federal programs**
    - Food banks should be supplement, not substitute
    - Adequate SNAP benefits reduce emergency food need
    - Track food bank demand as policy indicator

**Evidence**: Food banks are critical but cannot substitute for adequate federal programs. Integration increases access to both.

**Challenges**: Charitable sector limitations. Food industry influence on donations.
