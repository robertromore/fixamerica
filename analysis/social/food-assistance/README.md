# Food Assistance: Overview

Food assistance programs represent one of America's most effective anti-poverty interventions, lifting millions out of poverty annually while reducing food insecurity for tens of millions of households. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps, serves as the nation's primary nutrition safety net, providing benefits to approximately 42 million Americans at a cost exceeding $100 billion annually. Combined with targeted programs like WIC, school meals, and senior nutrition services, the food assistance system reaches over 50 million people. Despite this extensive reach, 13% of American households remain food insecure, and structural barriers prevent many eligible individuals from accessing benefits. The average SNAP benefit lasts only 21 days of the month, leaving participants to manage significant gaps in food security.
