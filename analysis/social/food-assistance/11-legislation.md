# Food Assistance: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Food assistance legislation operates primarily through the farm bill (reauthorized every 5 years), which contains Title IV (Nutrition) governing SNAP and related programs. Child nutrition programs are separately authorized through the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act and related legislation. This document provides model legislation to expand access, increase benefit adequacy, and modernize program administration.

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments are required for food assistance reform. Congress has broad authority under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) to establish nutrition assistance programs and set conditions for participation.

## Federal Legislation

### SNAP Benefit Adequacy Act

**Purpose**: Increase SNAP benefits to levels that provide actual food security throughout the month.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "SNAP Benefit Adequacy Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
    (1) the average SNAP benefit provides food security for only 21 days
        of the month;
    (2) the Thrifty Food Plan is based on unrealistic assumptions about
        food preparation time, food waste, and cooking skills;
    (3) SNAP benefits do not account for regional variation in food costs;
    (4) inadequate nutrition assistance results in food insecurity,
        poor health outcomes, and economic instability; and
    (5) SNAP lifted 4.2 million people out of poverty in the most recent
        year measured.

SEC. 3. THRIFTY FOOD PLAN MODERNIZATION.
(a) REVISED METHODOLOGY.—Section 3(u) of the Food and Nutrition Act of
    2008 (7 U.S.C. 2012(u)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    "(3) METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS.—In calculating the cost of the
        thrifty food plan, the Secretary shall—
        (A) assume not more than 30 minutes per day for food preparation;
        (B) account for realistic rates of food waste;
        (C) reflect the actual cost of food in communities where
            participants reside;
        (D) ensure that the plan provides adequate nutrition for the
            entire benefit period; and
        (E) review and update the plan not less frequently than every
            3 years."

SEC. 4. MINIMUM BENEFIT.
Section 8(a) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2017(a)) is
amended by striking "$23" and inserting "$100, adjusted annually for
inflation".

SEC. 5. REGIONAL COST ADJUSTMENT.
Section 8 of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2017) is amended
by adding at the end the following:
    "(j) GEOGRAPHIC ADJUSTMENT.—
        (1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall adjust maximum allotments
            to reflect geographic variation in food costs.
        (2) METHODOLOGY.—The Secretary shall establish not fewer than
            5 cost-of-food regions and adjust benefits accordingly.
        (3) FLOOR.—No household shall receive less than the national
            maximum allotment as a result of this adjustment."

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act takes effect October 1 of the fiscal year following enactment.
```

**Explanation**: Codifies Thrifty Food Plan methodology improvements to ensure benefits reflect realistic food costs and preparation constraints. Establishes meaningful minimum benefit and regional adjustments.

**Challenges**: Cost (estimated $25-35 billion annually). Opposition from fiscal conservatives.

**Refinements**: Phase-in over 3 years. Tie to demonstrated food security improvements.

        due to stigma, administrative barriers, or income just above limits;
    (3) school meal participation improves academic achievement,
        attendance, and health outcomes;
    (4) States implementing universal meals report reduced stigma,
        increased participation, and administrative savings; and
    (5) universal meals ensure no child goes hungry at school.

SEC. 3. UNIVERSAL FREE MEALS.
(a) AMENDMENT.—Section 9(b) of the Richard B. Russell National School
    Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1758(b)) is amended by adding at the end:

## Regulatory Framework

### USDA Food and Nutrition Service

**Authority**: Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, National School Lunch Act, Child Nutrition Act

**Key Regulatory Requirements**:

1. **Thrifty Food Plan Methodology**
    - Regular updates to reflect actual costs
    - Realistic assumptions about time and skills
    - Regional variation consideration

2. **SNAP Administration**
    - Application processing standards
    - Quality control requirements
    - Electronic benefit transfer standards
    - Retailer authorization

3. **School Meals**
    - Nutrition standards (Dietary Guidelines)
    - Community Eligibility Provision implementation
    - Verification requirements
    - Reimbursement rates

4. **Senior Nutrition**
    - Older Americans Act meal requirements
    - Targeting and prioritization
    - Coordination with SNAP

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **Spending Clause Authority**: Congress has broad authority to condition federal nutrition funding
- **Equal Protection**: Categorical exclusions (e.g., immigrants) subject to rational basis review
- **Due Process**: Beneficiaries entitled to notice and hearing before termination (*Goldberg v. Kelly*)

### Preemption Questions

- **Federal Floor**: States may exceed federal minimum but not restrict below
- **Immigrant Benefits**: States may provide state-funded benefits beyond federal eligibility
- **School Meals**: Federal nutrition standards preempt lower state standards

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Quality Control**: SNAP error rates subject to federal review; excessive errors trigger liability
- **Civil Rights**: Programs subject to Title VI non-discrimination requirements
- **Administrative Appeals**: Beneficiaries can appeal adverse decisions

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| State implementation variation | States can implement minimally within federal rules | High |
| Verification as barrier | Excessive documentation requirements deter participation | High |
| Retailer manipulation | SNAP retailers may charge higher prices or reduce quality | Medium |
| ABAWD exemption gaming | Limited exemption slots create inequity | Medium |
| CEP threshold manipulation | Districts may gerrymander to avoid threshold | Low |
| Benefit timing exploitation | End-of-month benefit exhaustion creates vulnerability | Medium |
| Work requirement verification | Monthly hour requirements difficult to document | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Benefit inadequacy | Benefits last only 21 days | Unrealistic Thrifty Food Plan |
| Low participation rates | 18% of eligible don't receive SNAP | Administrative barriers, stigma |
| ABAWD exclusions | 750,000+ lose benefits annually | Work requirement policy |
| Immigrant exclusion | Millions ineligible despite need | 1996 welfare reform law |
| Senior underenrollment | Only 48% of eligible seniors receive SNAP | Complexity, stigma, low benefits |
| Summer meal gap | Only 15% of school meal recipients get summer meals | Program structure, access |
| Emergency food reliance | 53 million rely on food banks | Inadequate public programs |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **For state implementation variation**: Establish federal minimum standards with enforcement; condition enhanced funding on best practices.

2. **For verification barriers**: Mandate electronic verification before requesting documentation; prohibit documentation-based denials when electronic verification possible.

3. **For benefit inadequacy**: Codify Thrifty Food Plan methodology requiring realistic assumptions; mandate adequacy review.

4. **For ABAWD exclusions**: Eliminate time limits entirely; convert to voluntary E&T with support services.

5. **For immigrant exclusion**: Restore eligibility for lawfully present immigrants; provide federal funding for state-funded programs for undocumented.

6. **For senior underenrollment**: Automatic enrollment via Social Security; simplified application; increased minimum benefit.

7. **For summer meal gap**: Permanent Summer EBT; automatic enrollment for school meal participants.

8. **For emergency food reliance**: Increase SNAP benefits to reduce food bank demand; increase TEFAP funding.

### General Implementation Concerns

- **State Capacity**: Federal technical assistance and funding for IT modernization needed
- **Political Resistance**: Build bipartisan coalition through farm bill politics and economic arguments
- **Data Systems**: Cross-agency data sharing requires privacy protections and interoperability
- **Funding**: Appropriations must match authorizations; mandatory funding preferred
- **Transition**: Protect current beneficiaries during implementation of changes
- **Monitoring**: Establish food security metrics to evaluate effectiveness
