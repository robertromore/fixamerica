# Food Assistance: Overview

## Executive Summary

Food assistance programs represent one of America's most effective anti-poverty interventions, lifting millions out of poverty annually while reducing food insecurity for tens of millions of households. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps, serves as the nation's primary nutrition safety net, providing benefits to approximately 42 million Americans at a cost exceeding $100 billion annually. Combined with targeted programs like WIC, school meals, and senior nutrition services, the food assistance system reaches over 50 million people. Despite this extensive reach, 13% of American households remain food insecure, and structural barriers prevent many eligible individuals from accessing benefits. The average SNAP benefit lasts only 21 days of the month, leaving participants to manage significant gaps in food security.

- How effective are current food assistance programs at reducing hunger and poverty?
- What barriers prevent eligible individuals from accessing benefits they qualify for?
- How should work requirements and time limits be balanced against anti-hunger goals?

## Core Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| SNAP participants | 42 million |
| SNAP annual spending | $100+ billion |
| Average SNAP benefit | $234/person/month |
| Food insecure households | 13% (17.3 million households) |
| Children receiving free/reduced lunch | 30 million |

## Why This Matters

Food assistance programs touch nearly every aspect of American society. They stabilize families during economic hardship, support child development and educational outcomes, improve health outcomes by reducing diet-related disease, stimulate local economies through food purchases, and reduce the long-term costs of poverty and malnutrition. Despite their proven effectiveness, these programs remain politically contested, with ongoing debates over eligibility, benefit adequacy, work requirements, and program design shaping millions of lives.
