# Food Assistance: Root Causes

## Why Food Insecurity Persists

Despite extensive food assistance programs, the United States maintains persistently high rates of food insecurity. Understanding the systemic causes reveals why programmatic solutions alone cannot solve hunger without addressing deeper structural issues.

## Structural Causes

### 1. Wage Stagnation and Income Inequality

**The Core Problem**: Low wages mean many working families cannot afford adequate food.

- Federal minimum wage ($7.25) unchanged since 2009
- 31% of SNAP recipients work while receiving benefits
- Two-thirds of SNAP households have earned income
- Median income for SNAP households: $10,400/year
- Working full-time at minimum wage: $15,080/year (below poverty for family of 2)

**Mechanism**: When wages fail to cover basic needs, food assistance becomes wage subsidy for low-paying employers.

### 2. High Cost of Living

**Housing Burden**:

- Average SNAP household spends 50%+ of income on housing
- After housing costs, food budget becomes residual
- Geographic areas with highest food costs also have highest housing costs
- "Heat or eat" tradeoffs during winter months

**Food Costs**:

- Healthy food costs more per calorie than processed food
- Food deserts limit access to affordable options
- Transportation costs to reach grocery stores
- Time costs of meal preparation for working families

### 3. Benefit Inadequacy by Design

**Thrifty Food Plan Problems**:

- Developed in 1975, based on unrealistic assumptions:
    - 2+ hours daily food preparation time
    - No food waste
    - Extensive cooking skills and equipment
    - Access to well-stocked grocery stores
- Even after 2021 update, benefits last average 21 days

**Benefit Erosion**:

- Benefits don't adjust for regional cost variation
- Inflation adjustments lag actual food price increases
- SNAP does not cover non-food necessities (soap, diapers, toiletries)

### 4. Administrative Barriers

**Complexity by Design**:

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Multiple applications | Separate systems for SNAP, WIC, school meals |
| Frequent recertification | 6-12 month renewals, documentation requirements |
| In-person requirements | Office visits for some states |
| Work reporting | Monthly documentation for ABAWDs |
| Asset tests | Paperwork to verify resources |

**Churn**: 20% of SNAP exits are administrative (paperwork failure), not income-based.

### 5. Work Requirements and Time Limits

**ABAWD Restrictions**:

- Able-bodied adults without dependents (18-49)
- Must work 80 hours/month or participate in training
- 3-month limit in 36-month period if not meeting requirement
- Limited exemption slots available

**Problems**:

- Jobs not always available, especially in rural areas
- Irregular hours don't meet monthly threshold
- Transportation barriers to employment
- Disability that doesn't meet formal criteria
- 750,000+ lose benefits annually to time limits

### 6. Categorical Exclusions

**Who Cannot Receive SNAP**:

| Population | Restriction |
|------------|-------------|
| Undocumented immigrants | Complete exclusion |
| Legal immigrants (<5 years) | Most excluded |
| College students | Restricted unless working 20+ hours |
| Drug felons (some states) | Lifetime ban |
| People with certain felonies | State-specific bans |

**Impact**: Creates holes in safety net based on status rather than need.

## Systemic Drivers

### Political Economy of Hunger

**Agricultural Interests vs. Anti-Hunger Interests**:

- Farm bill politics require urban-rural coalition
- SNAP spending enables farm subsidy support
- Agricultural commodity focus shaped program design
- Food industry profits from SNAP spending

**Industry Influence**:

- Retailers lobby against SNAP restrictions on purchases
- Food manufacturers oppose nutrition standards
- Agribusiness supports SNAP as market subsidy
- Anti-hunger advocates sometimes align with industry

### Ideology and Stigma

**"Deserving Poor" Framework**:

- Programs designed to distinguish "deserving" from "undeserving"
- Work requirements, time limits, and drug testing as moral tests
- Separate benefit systems create visible identification
- Political rhetoric about "dependency" and "fraud"

**Consequences**:

- Eligible people don't apply due to stigma
- Program administrators gatekeep access
- Benefits kept low to maintain work incentive
- Punitive requirements reduce effectiveness

### Federalism and State Variation

**State Implementation Choices**:

| Policy Area | State Variation |
|-------------|-----------------|
| ABAWD waivers | Some request; others don't |
| Asset limits | Range from none to $2,750 |
| Broad-based categorical eligibility | 39 states use; 11 don't |
| Online applications | Quality varies dramatically |
| Recertification frequency | 6-24 months |
| Immigrant eligibility | State-funded options vary |

**Race to the Bottom**: States compete to have less generous programs to avoid "welfare migration."

### Emergency Food as Substitute

**Food Bank Expansion**:

- Charitable food distributed: 6.6 billion pounds/year
- Replaces government function with voluntary sector
- Unpredictable, inadequate, and often lower quality
- Allows political escape from adequate public investment

**Structural Problem**: Food banks were designed for emergencies, not as permanent parallel food system.

## Feedback Loops

### Poverty Trap Dynamics

```text
Low wages → SNAP eligibility → Benefit cliff →
Disincentive to earn more → Trapped at low income
```

**Cliff Effects**: Earning slightly more can cause complete benefit loss, creating effective marginal tax rates over 100%.

### Health-Poverty Cycle

```text
Food insecurity → Poor nutrition → Health problems →
Medical costs → Deeper poverty → More food insecurity
```

**Diet-related disease**: Food insecurity linked to diabetes, obesity, heart disease, creating healthcare costs that dwarf nutrition program savings.

### Intergenerational Transmission

```text
Childhood food insecurity → Developmental impacts →
Lower educational attainment → Lower adult earnings →
Food insecurity for next generation
```

**Long-term costs**: Childhood hunger costs an estimated $160 billion annually in healthcare, education, and productivity losses.

## Why Current Approaches Fail

### Treating Symptoms, Not Causes

Programs address immediate food need without solving underlying income inadequacy. Food assistance is a band-aid on deeper economic wounds.

### Means-Testing Costs

- Administrative costs of determining eligibility
- Churn from paperwork-based exits
- Stigma reducing participation
- Errors in both directions (fraud and under-enrollment)

### Program Fragmentation

- SNAP, WIC, school meals, TEFAP, senior nutrition all have different:
    - Eligibility criteria
    - Application processes
    - Benefit structures
    - Administrative agencies
- Families must navigate multiple systems
- Gaps between programs leave needs unmet

### Countercyclical Weakness

- Automatic stabilizers are limited
- Benefits don't increase fast enough during recessions
- Political fights delay emergency response
- Recovery leads to cuts before need decreases
