5. "Maintain strong nutrition programs in the farm bill"

## Effective Advocacy

### Communicating with Legislators

**What Works**:

- Personal stories about food insecurity and program impact
- Local data on food insecurity and program participation
- Economic arguments (SNAP stimulates local economy)
- Child and senior focus (less politically contested)
- Constituent meetings and town halls
- Coordinated campaigns with allies

**Key Talking Points**:

1. **For SNAP expansion**: "SNAP lifted 4.2 million people out of poverty last year. Adequate benefits help families achieve food security and support local grocery stores."

2. **Against work requirements**: "Work requirements don't increase employment - they just create paperwork that cuts benefits from people who are already working or can't find jobs."

3. **For universal school meals**: "Universal school meals ensure no child goes hungry at school, reduce stigma, and improve academic outcomes. States that have implemented them see dramatic participation increases."

4. **For senior nutrition**: "Meals on Wheels has waitlists in 83% of programs. We're failing seniors who need help staying in their homes."
