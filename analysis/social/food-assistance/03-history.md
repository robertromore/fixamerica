# Food Assistance: History

## Historical Development

### Early Federal Involvement (1930s-1940s)

**Agricultural Surplus Programs**: Federal food assistance emerged primarily as a solution to agricultural overproduction, not hunger.

- **1933**: Federal Surplus Relief Corporation created to distribute surplus commodities
- **1935**: Section 32 of Agricultural Adjustment Act authorized purchase of surplus for domestic distribution
- **1939**: First Food Stamp Program launched as pilot in Rochester, NY
    - Orange stamps: Purchased at face value for any food
    - Blue stamps: Free bonus stamps (50% of orange) limited to surplus commodities
- **1943**: Program suspended due to full employment and end of agricultural surplus

**Key insight**: Food assistance was designed to support farm prices, with hunger relief as secondary benefit.

### Civil Rights Era and War on Poverty (1960s)

**Rediscovering Hunger**:

- **1961**: President Kennedy revives pilot Food Stamp Program
- **1964**: Food Stamp Act establishes permanent program
    - Purchase requirement: Poor families had to buy stamps
    - Benefit: Received bonus stamps worth more than purchase price
    - Limitation: County participation was optional
- **1966**: Child Nutrition Act creates School Breakfast Program
- **1968**: CBS documentary "Hunger in America" exposes widespread malnutrition
- **1969**: White House Conference on Food, Nutrition, and Health

**Key turning points**:

- Senate hearings documenting severe hunger in Mississippi Delta
- Medical teams finding malnutrition comparable to developing countries
- Political pressure to expand beyond agricultural interests

### Expansion Era (1970s)

**Food Stamp Modernization**:

- **1971**: National eligibility standards established
- **1973**: Program made mandatory in all counties
- **1974**: WIC pilot program created
- **1977**: Food Stamp Act of 1977:
    - Eliminated purchase requirement
    - Simplified eligibility
    - Established income limits at 130% FPL

**Child Nutrition Expansion**:

- **1975**: National School Lunch Program expanded
- **1975**: WIC made permanent
- **1978**: Child and Adult Care Food Program created

**Impact**: Participation jumped from 4 million (1970) to 21 million (1980).

### Retrenchment Era (1980s-1990s)

**Reagan Administration Cuts**:

- **1981**: Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act:
    - Reduced eligibility
    - Cut benefit levels
    - Imposed work registration requirements
- **1982**: Block grants reduced school meal funding
- **1983**: Economic Recovery Tax Act affected benefits

**Welfare Reform**:

- **1996**: Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA):
    - Renamed program as SNAP (though colloquially still "food stamps")
    - Imposed time limits for able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs)
    - 3-month limit in 3 years without working 80+ hours/month
    - Disqualified most legal immigrants
    - Gave states more flexibility/discretion
    - Established Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT)

**Farm Bill Integration**: Food stamps became primary spending item in farm bills, creating urban-rural political coalition.

### Modern Era (2000s-Present)

**Incremental Expansions**:

- **2002**: Farm Bill restored benefits to some legal immigrants
- **2008**: Farm Bill renamed program SNAP, expanded eligibility
- **2009**: American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) temporarily increased benefits
- **2010**: Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act improved school nutrition standards

**Great Recession Response**:

- Peak enrollment: 47.6 million (2013)
- Demonstrated countercyclical role of SNAP
- ARRA benefit increase expired 2013 (benefit cut)

**Pandemic Era**:

- **2020-2021**: Emergency allotments boosted all households to maximum benefit
- **2020**: Pandemic EBT provided grocery benefits for children missing school meals
- **2021**: Thrifty Food Plan update increased benefits 21%
- **2022**: Inflation Reduction Act maintained some expansions
- **2023**: Emergency allotments ended; benefits cut for 32 million people

## Lessons from History

1. **Agricultural origins shape policy**: Food assistance has always balanced anti-hunger and agricultural interests, sometimes prioritizing the latter

2. **Economic cycles drive participation**: Programs expand during recessions and face cuts during recoveries, demonstrating countercyclical importance

3. **Bipartisan coalitions possible**: Farm bill politics have historically united rural (agricultural) and urban (nutrition) interests

4. **Work requirements are persistent**: Despite limited evidence of effectiveness, work requirements have been repeatedly imposed and expanded

5. **Incremental progress is fragile**: Benefits expanded gradually, but can be cut quickly through budget reconciliation or regulatory changes

6. **Emergency response works**: Pandemic demonstrated capacity for rapid, effective expansion when political will exists

7. **Stigma by design**: Program structure (separate checkout, visible benefits) was intentionally designed to discourage participation

8. **Benefit adequacy never achieved**: The Thrifty Food Plan has always been based on unrealistic assumptions about food preparation time and access
