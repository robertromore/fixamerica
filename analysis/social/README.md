# Social: Overview

America's social safety net is fragmented, inadequate, and increasingly failing to prevent poverty. Despite spending over $700 billion annually on means-tested programs, 38 million Americans live in poverty—including 11 million children. The 1996 welfare reform gutted cash assistance, leaving TANF reaching only 21% of poor families compared to 68% before reform. SNAP benefits last only 21 days per month on average. SSI asset limits haven't changed since 1989. Unemployment insurance reaches only 28% of the jobless. Meanwhile, the 2021 Child Tax Credit expansion demonstrated that well-designed policy can cut child poverty nearly in half—but it was allowed to expire. This domain analyzes the safety net's failures and proposes comprehensive reforms.
