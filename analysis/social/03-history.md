# Social: History

## Overview

America's approach to poverty and social welfare reflects a distinctive historical trajectory shaped by federalism, racial politics, and ideological suspicion of government aid. From colonial poor laws modeled on English practice, through the transformative New Deal and Great Society eras, to the 1996 welfare "reform" that dismantled cash assistance, the safety net has expanded and contracted based on political coalitions, economic conditions, and evolving ideas about poverty, work, and deservingness. Understanding this history reveals how current programs emerged, why they take their particular forms, and what alternatives have been tried.
