# Social Services: Overview

America's social services system comprises over 50,000 community-based organizations delivering case management, family support, employment assistance, and wrap-around services to vulnerable populations. Yet this vast network operates in a fragmented, underfunded environment where TANF spends only 8% on work supports and job training, 400,000 children remain in foster care, and 700,000 social workers struggle with crushing caseloads. Community Action Agencies serve 16 million people annually, Head Start reaches 1 million children, and evidence-based programs like Nurse-Family Partnership demonstrate returns of $5 or more for every dollar invested. Despite proven models and dedicated professionals, social services remain chronically underfunded, poorly coordinated, and unable to scale what works.
