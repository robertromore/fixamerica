# Social Services: Current State

## The Social Services Landscape Today

### An Underfunded, Fragmented System

America's social services operate through a vast but poorly coordinated network of government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and community groups. Over 50,000 organizations provide services ranging from case management to employment assistance to family support, yet most families in need struggle to access comprehensive, coordinated help. The system is characterized by chronic underfunding, high staff turnover, siloed programs, and an inability to scale evidence-based interventions.

**Key Current Statistics**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total social services spending (non-health) | ~$200 billion annually |
| Community-based organizations | 50,000+ |
| Social workers in U.S. | 708,000 |
| Community Action Agencies | 1,000+ |
| Families served by CAAs | 16 million people |
| Head Start enrollment | 833,000 children |
| TANF work activities spending | 8% of total |
| Children in foster care | 391,000 |
| FQHC patients | 30.4 million |

## Case Management and Service Coordination

### Current State of Case Management

Case management is the linchpin of social services, connecting families to resources and coordinating across programs. Yet it remains fragmented and under-resourced.

**Case Management Landscape**

| Setting | Approach | Caseload Issues |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| TANF | Compliance-focused | Often 100+ per worker |
| Child welfare | Investigation and safety | 20-30+ vs. 12 recommended |
| Healthcare | Medical focus | Variable |
| Community-based | Holistic but limited | Resource-constrained |
| Mental health | Clinical coordination | Severe shortages |

**The Coordination Gap**

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Multiple case managers | Family has 3-5 different coordinators |
| No data sharing | Each agency starts from scratch |
| Conflicting requirements | Programs contradict each other |
| No single point of contact | Family must navigate alone |
| Time limits | Case management ends before stability |

### What Effective Case Management Looks Like

**Best Practices** (rarely implemented at scale):

- Single point of contact for family
- Strength-based, not compliance-focused
- Access to flexible funds for emergencies
- Reasonable caseloads (1:15-20)
- Long-term engagement (2+ years)
- Cross-agency coordination authority

## TANF Employment Services

### The Work-First Failure

TANF was designed around "work-first"--pushing recipients into immediate employment. Yet only 8% of TANF spending goes to work supports and job training.

**TANF Spending by Category (2022)**

| Category | Share of Spending | Amount |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Cash assistance | 22% | $3.6 billion |
| Work supports/job training | 8% | $1.3 billion |
| Child care | 16% | $2.6 billion |
| Administration | 10% | $1.6 billion |
| "Other" (unrestricted) | 30% | $4.9 billion |
| Pre-K/education services | 8% | $1.3 billion |
| Pregnancy prevention | 4% | $0.7 billion |

**Employment Outcomes**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| TANF recipients employed | ~30% of adults |
| Average hourly wage of leavers | $10-12/hour |
| Job retention at 1 year | ~50% |
| Advancement to living wage | Rare |

**Why Work-First Fails**

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Barrier blindness | Ignores disabilities, trauma, care responsibilities |
| Low-quality jobs | Pushes into unstable, low-wage work |
| No skills building | Limits vocational training to 12 months |
| Sanctions focus | Punishes non-compliance vs. addresses barriers |
| No follow-up | Case management ends with employment |

### What States Spend TANF On

States have broad discretion in TANF spending, leading to wide variation:

**State Variation in Cash Assistance Share**

| State | Cash Assistance Share |
|-------|----------------------|
| Oregon | 51% |
| California | 40% |
| Texas | 7% |
| Louisiana | 5% |
| Arizona | 4% |

Some states redirect TANF to fill state budget gaps unrelated to poverty.

## Child Welfare Services

### The Child Welfare System in Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Children in foster care (FY 2022) | 391,000 |
| Children entering foster care annually | 209,000 |
| Children exiting foster care annually | 216,000 |
| Median time in foster care | 13 months |
| Children awaiting adoption | 113,000 |
| Youth aging out (no permanent home) | 17,000 annually |

### The Removal-Heavy System

The U.S. child welfare system emphasizes investigation and removal over prevention and family preservation.

**Spending Priorities**

| Category | Federal Share |
|----------|---------------|
| Foster care maintenance | 60%+ of Title IV-E |
| Adoption assistance | 20%+ |
| Prevention services | 14% (post-Family First) |
| Family preservation | Limited |

**The Investigation Pipeline**

| Stage | Number (2022) |
|-------|---------------|
| Reports received | 4 million |
| Reports screened in | 2.2 million |
| Children subject to investigation | 3.5 million |
| Substantiated victims | 588,000 |
| Removed to foster care | 209,000 |

### Racial Disparities in Child Welfare

| Group | Share of Population | Share of Foster Care |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| White | 50% | 42% |
| Black | 14% | 23% |
| Hispanic | 26% | 21% |
| Native American | 1% | 2% |

Black and Native American children are vastly over-represented in foster care.

### Family First Prevention Services Act Impact

The 2018 Family First Prevention Services Act shifted funding toward prevention for the first time:

**Key Changes**:
- Federal funding for evidence-based prevention services
- Restrictions on congregate care (group homes)
- Support for kinship care
- Required evidence standards for prevention programs

**Implementation Status (2024)**:
- All states have submitted prevention plans
- Evidence-based program capacity building underway
- Congregate care declining
- Full impact yet to be measured

### The Caseworker Crisis

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Average caseload | 20-30+ children (vs. 12-15 recommended) |
| Annual turnover | 30-40% in some jurisdictions |
| Starting salary | $35,000-45,000 typically |
| Burnout rates | Among highest of any profession |
| Secondary trauma | Widespread among workers |

## Family Support Services

### Home Visiting Programs

Home visiting delivers services in the family's home, building relationships and providing support during critical early years.

**Federal Home Visiting (MIECHV)**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual funding | $400 million |
| Families served | 140,000 |
| Evidence-based models | 24 approved |
| States participating | All 50 + DC + territories |

**Evidence-Based Home Visiting Models**

| Model | Focus | Evidence |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Nurse-Family Partnership | First-time low-income mothers | Strongest evidence base |
| Parents as Teachers | Parent education | School readiness gains |
| Healthy Families America | Child abuse prevention | Reduced maltreatment |
| Home Instruction (HIPPY) | School readiness | Academic improvements |
| Early Head Start-HV | Comprehensive infant/toddler | Development gains |

**The Scale Problem**

| Population | Need vs. Reality |
|------------|------------------|
| First-time mothers in poverty | 1 million annually |
| Served by NFP | 50,000 |
| All eligible families | 3+ million |
| All families in home visiting | 150,000 |
| **Coverage rate** | **3-5%** |

### Parenting Programs

| Program Type | Examples | Reach |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| Parent education | Parents as Teachers, Triple P | Limited |
| Parent support groups | Parenting classes | Variable |
| Family therapy | Functional Family Therapy | Very limited |
| Parent-child interaction | PCIT | Very limited |

Most evidence-based parenting programs reach a tiny fraction of families who could benefit.

## Community Action Agencies

### The Community Action Network

Community Action Agencies (CAAs) were created in 1964 as part of the War on Poverty to address poverty at the community level through local organizations governed in part by low-income community members.

**Community Action Today**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Number of CAAs | 1,000+ |

| Vacancy rates | 15-30% in child welfare |
| Annual turnover | 20-40% in high-stress settings |
| Burnout rates | 40%+ report high burnout |
| Caseloads | Often 2-3x recommended |
| Student debt | Average $40,000+ |
| Pay gap | 20-30% below comparable professions |

### What Social Workers Do

| 501(c)(3) nonprofits | 1.5+ million |
| Human services organizations | 100,000+ |
| Employment | 12+ million |
| Annual revenue | $400+ billion |

### Government Contracting

Most social services are delivered by nonprofits under government contracts:

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Cost reimbursement | Often below true costs |
| Indirect cost limits | Undermine organizational health |
| Short contract cycles | Create instability |
| Reporting burden | Diverts resources from services |
| Payment delays | Cash flow crises |
| Competition | Fragments service landscape |

### The Nonprofit Struggle

| Challenge | Prevalence |
|-----------|------------|
| Operating with deficit | 25% of nonprofits |
| Limited reserves | Majority have <3 months |
| Staff turnover | Higher than private sector |
| Executive burnout | Widespread |
| Mission creep | Chasing funding vs. strategy |

## Faith-Based Organizations

### Role in Social Services

Faith-based organizations (FBOs) are major providers of social services, including direct delivery and through government contracts.

**Scope of Faith-Based Services**

| Sector | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Emergency services | Food pantries, shelters, disaster relief |
| Family services | Adoption, foster care, counseling |
| Refugee resettlement | Major USRA contractors |
| Recovery programs | Treatment, support groups |
| Community development | CDCs, CDFIs |

**Major Faith-Based Providers**

| Organization | Services |
|--------------|----------|
| Catholic Charities | Comprehensive social services |
| Salvation Army | Emergency, rehabilitation, shelters |
| Lutheran Services | Immigration, child welfare, aging |
| Jewish Family Services | Family services, refugee |
| Islamic Relief | Humanitarian, domestic services |
| Church-based | 350,000+ congregations offering some service |

### Charitable Choice and Government Funding

Since 1996, faith-based organizations can receive government funding:

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Cannot require religious participation | Required |
| Must serve all eligible | Required |
| Can maintain religious identity | Permitted |
| Hiring exemptions | Contested |
| Separate secular/religious accounting | Required for federal |

## Evidence-Based Programs

### The Evidence Landscape

The field has developed rigorous standards for "evidence-based" programs:

**Evidence Tiers (Common Framework)**

| Tier | Standard | Example Programs |
|------|----------|------------------|
| Well-supported | Multiple RCTs | Nurse-Family Partnership |
| Supported | One RCT | Many home visiting models |
| Promising | Quasi-experimental | Emerging programs |
| Needs evaluation | Theory-based only | Most community programs |

### Nurse-Family Partnership (Model Program)

**NFP Structure**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Population | First-time low-income mothers |
| Intervention | Nurse home visits, pregnancy-age 2 |
| Frequency | Regular visits over 2.5 years |
| Focus | Health, parenting, life course |

**NFP Outcomes**

| Outcome | Finding |
|---------|---------|
| Child abuse/neglect | 48% reduction |
| Emergency room visits | 35% fewer |
| Subsequent pregnancies | Reduced and delayed |
| Maternal employment | Increased |
| Criminal behavior (children) | Reduced |
| Government spending | Reduced long-term |

**NFP Return on Investment**

| Analysis | ROI |
|----------|-----|
| RAND Corporation | $5.70 per $1 invested |
| Washington State | $3.23 per $1 (conservative) |
| Pew/MacArthur | Strong positive |

### The Scale Challenge

| Program | Eligible Population | Actually Served | Coverage |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Nurse-Family Partnership | 1 million | 50,000 | 5% |
| Home visiting (all) | 3+ million | 150,000 | 5% |
| Evidence-based parenting | Millions | Thousands | <1% |

## Two-Generation Approaches

### What 2Gen Means

Two-generation (2Gen) approaches address parents and children together, recognizing that family success requires whole-family support.

**2Gen vs. Traditional**

| Element | Traditional | Two-Generation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Focus | Parent OR child | Both together |
| Services | Separate systems | Integrated |
| Goals | Individual | Family success |
| Assessment | Single member | Whole family |
| Success measure | Individual outcome | Family economic mobility |

### 2Gen Program Examples

| Program | Structure |
|---------|-----------|
| CAP Tulsa | Head Start + parent career training |
| CareerAdvance | Parent employment + child care |
| Jeremiah Program | Housing + education + child development |
| Family Independence Initiative | Peer support + resources |

### 2Gen Evidence Base

- Growing evidence of effectiveness
- Whole-family gains exceed single-generation
- Parent success supports child development
- Child development enables parent employment
- Breaking intergenerational poverty cycle

## Benefits Navigation

### The Navigation Challenge

| 211 services | United Way | Information and referral |

### What Navigation Improves

| Metric | With Navigation |
|--------|-----------------|
| Application completion | Higher |
| Enrollment rates | 20-50% increase |
| Benefits received | More programs accessed |
| Income improvement | Families get entitled benefits |

## Key Challenges Summary

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Fragmentation | Families navigate 5-10 agencies |
| Underfunding | Programs serve fraction of eligible |
| Workforce crisis | Turnover undermines quality |
| Scale barriers | Evidence-based programs don't spread |
| Prevention deficit | System responds to crisis vs. prevents |
| Coordination failure | No one responsible for family outcomes |
| Racial disparities | Inequitable access and outcomes |
