# Social Services: History

## The Evolution of American Social Services

### Overview

American social services evolved from private charity in the 19th century to a mixed public-private system shaped by the Settlement House movement, the New Deal, the War on Poverty, and 1996 welfare reform. This history reveals recurring tensions between public and private roles, between professional expertise and community empowerment, and between helping individuals and changing systems.

## The Charity Era (Pre-1900)

### Private Charity and Moral Reform

Before the 20th century, social services were almost entirely private, dominated by:

| Provider | Approach | Philosophy |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Churches | Congregational aid | Christian duty |
| Charity Organization Societies | "Scientific charity" | Individual moral reform |
| Almshouses | Institutional care | Deserving vs. undeserving |
| Mutual aid societies | Ethnic/occupational | Self-help |

**The Charity Organization Movement (1870s-1900s)**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Central registry | Track recipients across agencies |
| Investigation | Determine "worthiness" |
| Friendly visiting | Middle-class women visit poor |
| Goal | Reform behavior, not provide relief |
| View of poverty | Moral failing |

### The Settlement House Movement (1880s-1920s)

Settlement houses took a radically different approach:

**Philosophy**

- Poverty caused by environment, not character
- College-educated residents live in poor neighborhoods
- Learn from and with community
- Advocacy for systemic change
- Research-based reform

**Key Settlement Houses**

| Settlement | Location | Founded | Key Figures |
|------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Hull House | Chicago | 1889 | Jane Addams, Florence Kelley |

## The New Deal Era (1933-1945)
