## Guiding Principles for Reform

### Evidence-Based Approach

Reform should be guided by evidence of what works:
- Scale programs with demonstrated effectiveness
- Invest in rigorous evaluation
- Adapt to local context while maintaining core elements
- Learn from implementation experience

### Prevention Over Crisis Response

Shift resources toward preventing problems:
- Early childhood investment
- Family support before crisis
- Upstream intervention
- Long-term cost savings

### Whole-Family (Two-Generation) Focus

Address parents and children together:
- Family economic mobility
- Child development and parent success linked
- Integrated service delivery
- Family-centered assessment

### Integration and Coordination

Break down silos:
- Single point of contact for families
- Data sharing across programs
- Coordinated eligibility and enrollment
- Shared goals and outcomes

### Adequate Funding

Provide resources to meet need:
- Scale evidence-based programs
- Competitive workforce compensation
- Reasonable caseloads
- Infrastructure investment
