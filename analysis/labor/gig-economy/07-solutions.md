# Gig Economy: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

### Core Values

**Worker Dignity**

- All workers deserve basic protections regardless of classification
- Economic dependence should trigger labor law protections
- Flexibility should empower workers, not just employers
- Work should provide pathways out of poverty, not into it

**Economic Security**

- Workers should have access to healthcare, retirement, unemployment insurance
- Earnings should be transparent, predictable, and adequate
- Expenses should be reimbursed; risks should be compensated
- Social insurance should follow workers across jobs and platforms

**Democratic Workplace**

- Workers should have voice in setting terms and conditions
- Collective action should be protected, not prohibited
- Algorithmic decisions should be transparent and appealable
- Deactivation should require due process

**Fair Competition**

- Businesses should compete on quality and efficiency, not labor exploitation
- Traditional employers shouldn't face unfair competition from misclassification
- Platforms should bear the true costs of their services
- Taxpayers shouldn't subsidize platform business models

### Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Effectiveness | Does it meaningfully improve worker conditions? |
| Enforceability | Can it be implemented against well-resourced opposition? |
| Flexibility preservation | Does it allow genuine flexibility while preventing abuse? |
| Political feasibility | Can it survive legislative and legal challenges? |
| Coalition building | Does it unite diverse stakeholders? |
| Durability | Can it withstand platform adaptation and evasion? |

## Classification Reform

### The ABC Test

**What Is the ABC Test?**

Under the ABC test, a worker is an employee unless the hiring entity proves:

- **(A)** The worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity
- **(B)** The worker performs work outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business
- **(C)** The worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business

**Why It Works**

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Bright-line rules | Clear standards, less manipulation |
| Employer burden of proof | Shifts presumption to worker protection |
| B prong is decisive | Rideshare drivers are in the rideshare business |
| Already tested | Used in many states for unemployment insurance |

**Application to Gig Platforms**

| Prong | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| A (Control) | Platforms control through algorithms, ratings, deactivation |
| B (Business) | Uber is in the transportation business; drivers are its product |
| C (Independent trade) | Most drivers don't have independent businesses |

**Result**: Under ABC test, gig platform workers are employees.

### Federal ABC Test Adoption

**PRO Act Approach**

The Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO Act) includes:

- ABC test for NLRA coverage (organizing rights)
- Applies to all workers, including gig workers
- Passed House 2021; stalled in Senate

**Comprehensive Federal Standard**

Beyond the PRO Act, a federal standard should:

- Apply ABC test across all labor laws (FLSA, OSHA, anti-discrimination)
- Preempt weaker state standards
- Provide robust enforcement mechanisms
- Include private right of action

### State ABC Test Adoption

**Successful Models**

| State | Law | Status |
|-------|-----|--------|
| California | AB5 | Enacted 2019; Prop 22 carve-out |
| New Jersey | Misclassification statute | ABC test for employment law |
| Massachusetts | Common law | ABC test precedent |
| Illinois | Classification test | ABC for unemployment |

**Implementation Lessons**

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Exemptions create loopholes | Minimize carve-outs |
| Enforcement resources matter | Fund labor agencies |
| Ballot measures are vulnerable | Prepare for platform response |
| Clear communication needed | Counter "flexibility" narrative |

## Portable Benefits

### Concept

**What Are Portable Benefits?**

- Benefits that follow workers across employers and platforms
- Pro-rated contributions based on hours worked
- Accessible regardless of classification status
- Funded by employer/platform contributions

**Core Components**

| Benefit | Design |
|---------|--------|
| Healthcare | Per-hour contributions to fund coverage |
| Retirement | Mandatory contributions to portable accounts |
| Paid leave | Accrued based on hours worked |
| Workers' compensation | Pooled insurance fund |
| Unemployment | Modified to cover non-traditional work |

### Design Options

**Contribution Model**

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Per-hour contribution | Platforms pay fixed amount per hour worked |
| Percentage of earnings | Contribution tied to worker earnings |
| Per-transaction fee | Contribution per ride, delivery, task |
| Minimum floor | Guarantee minimum annual contribution |

**Contribution Rates**

| Benefit | Suggested Rate |
|---------|---------------:|
| Healthcare | $3-5 per hour |
| Retirement | 5-10% of earnings |
| Paid leave | 3-5% of earnings |
| Workers' compensation | 2-4% of earnings |
| Training/transition | 1-2% of earnings |

**Administration**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Public agency | State or federal administration |
| Nonprofit fund | Industry-specific fund |
| Multi-employer plan | Joint labor-management |
| Individual accounts | Worker-owned, portable |

### Critiques and Responses

**Concern: Legitimizes Contractor Status**

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Accepts misclassification | Can be combined with stronger classification |
| Lets platforms off hook | Contributions still impose costs |
| Worse than employee status | Better than current nothing |

**Concern: Administrative Complexity**

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Hard to track hours | Platforms already track; require reporting |
| Fragmented coverage | Centralized fund solves |
| Enforcement challenges | Build on existing UI systems |

**Strategic Consideration**

Portable benefits can be:

- A complement to ABC test (benefits for those who remain contractors)
- An interim step while classification is contested
- A second-best alternative if classification fails politically

**Not a substitute for proper classification.**

## Direct Regulation of Platform Practices

### Minimum Standards

**Earnings Floors**

| Standard | Design |
|----------|--------|
| Minimum hourly guarantee | Includes waiting/travel time |
| Expense reimbursement | Federal mileage rate or actual costs |
| Tip transparency | Tips go to workers; no tip pooling by platform |
| Surge sharing | Workers receive fair share of surge pricing |

**New York City Model (Delivery Workers)**

- Minimum pay per trip: ~$18/hour (including time between deliveries)
- Excludes tips from calculation
- Transparency requirements for pay calculations

**Washington State Model (Rideshare)**

- Minimum per-mile and per-minute rates
- Paid sick leave
- Workers' compensation access
- Right to see trip details before accepting

### Algorithmic Accountability

**Transparency Requirements**

| Requirement | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Explain how pay is calculated | Workers understand earnings |
| Disclose factors affecting assignment | See algorithmic priorities |
| Show acceptance rate consequences | Understand deactivation risk |
| Reveal platform take rate | Know revenue division |

**Due Process Protections**

| Protection | Application |
|------------|-------------|
| Written notice before deactivation | No surprise termination |
| Explanation of reasons | Know what triggered action |
| Appeal process | Independent review |
| Reinstatement remedies | Undo wrongful deactivation |

**Anti-Discrimination**

| Requirement | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Algorithm audits | Check for discriminatory effects |
| Data access | Regulators can investigate |
| Disparate impact standards | Apply civil rights framework |

### Safety Requirements

**Vehicle and Equipment**

| Standard | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| Vehicle safety inspections | Regular required checks |
| Insurance requirements | Adequate coverage |
| Equipment standards | Safe bags, vehicles |

**Working Conditions**

| Requirement | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Rest break requirements | Prevent exhaustion |
| Maximum hours guidance | Address overwork |
| Harassment policies | Platform responsibility |
| Bathroom access | Dignity in work |

## Collective Action Rights

### Organizing Protections

**Federal NLRA Coverage**

- PRO Act would extend organizing rights to gig workers
- Employers could not interfere with organizing
- Workers could form unions, bargain collectively
- Arbitration waivers prohibited for labor disputes

**State Approaches**

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Collective bargaining rights | Seattle attempted (preempted) |
| Worker boards | Sectoral bargaining for gig economy |
| Antitrust exemption | Allow coordinated action without antitrust liability |

### Sectoral Bargaining

**What Is Sectoral Bargaining?**

- Industry-wide negotiations covering all workers
- Standards apply regardless of which company employs workers
- Prevents race to bottom between platforms
- Common in Europe, less in U.S.

**Application to Gig Economy**

| Sector | Coverage |
|--------|----------|
| Rideshare | All drivers across Uber, Lyft, etc. |
| Delivery | All delivery workers across DoorDash, Instacart, etc. |
| Task-based | All workers on TaskRabbit, Handy, etc. |

**Benefits**

- Takes labor costs out of competition
- Establishes industry-wide standards
- Stronger worker voice through unified bargaining
- Prevents platform-specific organizing challenges

## International Models

### European Union Platform Work Directive (2024)

**Key Provisions**

| Provision | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Employment presumption | Workers presumed employees unless proven otherwise |
| Algorithm transparency | Platforms must explain automated decisions |
| Human oversight | Significant decisions require human review |
| Right to contest | Workers can challenge algorithmic decisions |

**Implementation**

- Member states must transpose into national law
- Platforms must adjust or face penalties
- Significant model for U.S. reform

### United Kingdom

**Uber BV v. Aslam (2021)**

- Supreme Court ruled Uber drivers are "workers" (intermediate category)
- Entitled to minimum wage, paid holidays, protection from discrimination
- Applied reality-based test, not contract language

**Implications**

- Demonstrates that platforms can operate with worker protections
- UK drivers received back pay
- Model for intermediate status if full employment rejected

### Spain Riders Law (2021)

**Provisions**

- Delivery riders presumed employees
- Algorithm transparency required
- Union negotiation rights
- Platform liable for workplace accidents

**Results**

- Platforms shifted to employee model
- Some platforms exited market
- Remaining platforms adapted

## Trade-offs and Debates

### Full Employment vs. Third Category

**Full Employee Classification**

| Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-----------|--------------|
| Comprehensive protection | May be politically blocked |
| Clear legal standard | Platforms will fight harder |
| Tested framework | Less flexibility for genuine independents |

**Third/Intermediate Category**

| Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-----------|--------------|
| May be more politically achievable | Creates new classification to game |
| Addresses flexibility concerns | Dilutes employee protections |
| Compromise position | May satisfy no one |

**Strategic Considerations**

- Push for full employment; accept intermediate as fallback
- Intermediate category must be robust, not platform-designed
- Avoid creating new loopholes

### Sector-Specific vs. Universal Approach

**Sector-Specific**

| Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-----------|--------------|
| Tailored to platform realities | Creates complexity |
| Addresses unique issues | May miss cross-platform workers |
| Can start with worst actors | Incomplete coverage |

**Universal Standards**

| Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-----------|--------------|
| Comprehensive protection | May not fit all situations |
| Prevents arbitrage | More politically difficult |
| Simpler administration | Less tailored to specific sectors |

### State vs. Federal Action

**Federal Solution**

| Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-----------|--------------|
| Nationwide standard | Harder to pass (filibuster) |
| Prevents state patchwork | Slower process |
| Can preempt weak laws | Current political balance |

**State-by-State**

| Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-----------|--------------|
| Easier to pass in some states | Platforms can flee to weak states |
| Laboratory of democracy | Exhausts reformer resources |
| Local organizing opportunity | Prop 22-style ballot measures |

## What Has Worked

|--------|---------|
| NYC delivery minimum wage | Significant pay increase |
| Washington State rideshare law | Minimum rates, paid leave |
| California AB5 | Clear standard (despite Prop 22) |
| Massachusetts settlement | $175M recovery, some protections |
| Minnesota rideshare law | Minimum standards enacted |

### Successful Strategies
