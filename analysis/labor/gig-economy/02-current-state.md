## Impact

### On Gig Workers

**Economic Hardship**

|-----------|------------:|----------------------:|
| Poverty rate | 14% | 9% |
| Food insecurity | 18% | 10% |
| Housing cost-burdened | 45% | 30% |
| Emergency expense ($400) | 45% can't cover | 63% can cover |
| No retirement savings | 60% | 30% |

**Physical and Mental Health**

| Issue | Prevalence |
|-------|-----------|
| Work-related injuries (unreported/uncompensated) | Common |
| Vehicle accidents (rideshare/delivery) | Higher than average |
| Stress from income volatility | Widespread |
| Anxiety about deactivation | Significant |
| Lack of preventive care (uninsured) | Common |

| Minimum wage | Not guaranteed |
| Overtime | Not applicable |
| Discrimination protection | Limited |
| Sexual harassment protection | Arbitration-bound |
| Right to organize | Legally unclear |
| Safety requirements | Minimal |

### On Taxpayers

**Cost Shifting to Public Programs**

| Category | Estimated Annual Cost |
|----------|----------------------:|
| Medicaid (uninsured gig workers) | $3-6 billion |
| SNAP (food assistance) | $1-2 billion |
| EITC (subsidizing low wages) | $2-4 billion |
| Unpaid state unemployment insurance | $500 million - $1 billion |
| Unpaid workers' compensation premiums | $500 million - $1 billion |
| Lost tax revenue (misclassification) | $8-12 billion |

**Total Taxpayer Subsidy of Platform Companies**: $15-26 billion annually

### On Traditional Employers

**Competitive Pressure**

| Sector | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Taxi/livery | Devastated by rideshare competition using misclassified workers |
| Traditional delivery | Undercut on labor costs |
| Restaurants | Pressured to reduce staff, use delivery apps |
| Retail | Competing with gig-enabled same-day delivery |
| Home services | Independent contractors undercut traditional employers |

**Race to the Bottom**

Legitimate employers who properly classify workers face:

- 30-40% higher labor costs than gig platforms
- Pressure to convert employees to contractors
- Difficulty competing on price
- Temptation to exit markets

### On the Economy

**Structural Changes**

| Trend | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| Fissured workplace expansion | Less employer responsibility |
| Erosion of standard employment | Fewer stable jobs |
| Reduced worker bargaining power | Wage stagnation |
| Social insurance gaps | Retirement crisis deepening |
| Demand instability | Consumption volatility |

## Recent Developments

### Legal and Regulatory

**Federal Level**

| Development | Date | Status |
|-------------|------|--------|
| DOL independent contractor rule (Biden) | 2024 | Implemented, challenged |
| PRO Act (includes ABC test) | 2021- | Passed House, stalled in Senate |
| FTC gig economy workshop | 2023 | Ongoing inquiry |
| NLRB Amazon/Uber cases | 2023-2024 | Pending decisions |

**State Level**

| State | Action | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| California | AB5 (ABC test), Prop 22 override | Prop 22 partially struck down (2024) |
| Massachusetts | AG lawsuit against Uber/Lyft | Settled 2024, $175M, some benefits |
| New York | Minimum wage for app delivery | Implemented 2023 |
| Washington | Rideshare minimum standards | Implemented 2024 |

| Illinois | Freelance Worker Protection Act | Passed 2023 |

### Platform Company Responses

**Concessions**

|----------|----------|
| Uber/Lyft (Massachusetts) | $175M settlement, some earnings floor |
| DoorDash | Insurance pilots, earnings transparency |
| Instacart | Tip protections, injury insurance |
| General | Rhetoric about "flexibility," limited actual changes |

**Resistance**

| Tactic | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Litigation | Challenging DOL rule, state laws |
| Ballot measures | Prop 22, proposed measures in other states |
| Lobbying | Massive federal and state lobbying |
| Threats | Threatening to exit markets, raise prices |
| App manipulation | Reducing access to work for outspoken workers |

### International Comparisons

**EU Platform Work Directive (2024)**

| Provision | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Employment presumption | Workers presumed employees unless proven otherwise |
| Algorithm transparency | Platforms must disclose automated decision-making |
| Human oversight | Significant decisions must involve humans |
| Right to explanation | Workers can challenge algorithmic decisions |

**Other Countries**

| Country | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| UK | Supreme Court ruled Uber drivers are "workers" (2021) |
| Spain | "Riders Law" creates employment presumption (2021) |
| France | Minimum rights for platform workers (2022) |
| Australia | Gig worker death prompts legislative action (2024) |
| Canada | Provincial variation, some protections emerging |

### Emerging Issues

**Algorithmic Management**

- Growing awareness of algorithmic control over gig workers
- Wage theft through app manipulation
- Discriminatory algorithm impacts
- Mental health effects of constant surveillance and rating

**AI and Automation**

- Autonomous vehicle threat to rideshare drivers
- Drone delivery implications
- AI task allocation reducing worker agency
- Future of gig work uncertain

## Classification Standards Today

### Federal Tests

**IRS 20-Factor Test**

Complex, totality-of-circumstances test that considers:

- Behavioral control
- Financial control
- Type of relationship

**DOL Economic Reality Test**

Six factors considering economic dependence:

1. Opportunity for profit or loss
2. Investment in equipment/facilities
3. Permanence of relationship
4. Degree of skill required
5. Integral nature of services
6. Control by employer

**2024 DOL Rule Update**

Returned to totality-of-circumstances approach, considering:

- Workers' economic dependence on the potential employer
- The degree of control the employer exercises
- No single factor is determinative

### State Approaches

**ABC Test States** (strictest)

| State | Status |
|-------|--------|
| California | AB5 passed, Prop 22 carve-out |
| New Jersey | ABC test for unemployment |
| Massachusetts | ABC test for employment law |
| Connecticut | ABC test for wage law |
| Illinois | ABC test for some purposes |

**The ABC Test**

Worker is employee unless:

- (A) Free from control and direction
- (B) Work is outside usual course of business
- (C) Worker has independent business/trade

**Implications of B Prong**: Rideshare companies are in the ride business; therefore their drivers are employees.
