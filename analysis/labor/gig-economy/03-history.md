# Gig Economy: History

## Origins

### The Independent Contractor Before Technology

**Traditional Independent Contractors**

Before the platform economy, independent contractors were primarily:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Licensed professionals | Doctors, lawyers, accountants |
| Skilled trades | Plumbers, electricians, construction |
| Creative workers | Writers, artists, photographers |
| Specialized consultants | Management, IT, engineering |

**Key Characteristics**

- Genuine entrepreneurial autonomy
- Specialized skills or professional credentials
- Control over work methods, pricing, clients
- Investment in business infrastructure
- Multiple clients over time

**Legal Framework Development**

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 1930s | New Deal labor laws established employee protections |
| 1935 | NLRA: right to organize for employees |
| 1938 | FLSA: minimum wage, overtime for employees |
| 1947 | Taft-Hartley limited labor organizing |
| 1948 | IRS began distinguishing employees from contractors |
| 1970s-80s | Courts developed multi-factor tests |

### Rise of the "Fissured Workplace"

**1980s-2000s: Outsourcing and Subcontracting**

| Trend | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Manufacturing outsourcing | Production moved to contractors, overseas |
| Service subcontracting | Janitorial, security, food service externalized |
| Temp agencies | Manpower, Kelly Services grew rapidly |
| Franchise expansion | McDonald's model spread liability to franchisees |
| PEO growth | Professional Employer Organizations assumed HR functions |

**Purpose of Fissuring**

1. Reduce labor costs by 20-40%
2. Shift legal liability away from brand companies
3. Avoid union organizing (smaller workplaces)
4. Increase "flexibility" (fire without consequences)
5. Externalize benefits costs

**David Weil's Analysis**

Labor economist David Weil documented how lead firms:

- Shed direct employment while maintaining control
- Created plausible deniability for labor violations
- Pressured subcontractors on cost, leading to wage theft
- Made enforcement of labor law increasingly difficult

## Key Turning Points

### 2008-2009: Financial Crisis as Catalyst

**Economic Conditions**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Unemployment | Peaked at 10% (October 2009) |
| Underemployment | Real rate over 17% |
| Housing crisis | Millions lost homes, savings |
| Credit crunch | Small business lending collapsed |
| Foreclosures | 3.8 million in 2010 alone |

**Labor Market Desperation**

- Millions willing to take any work available
- Traditional job security evaporated
- "Sharing economy" rhetoric appealed to unemployed
- Gig work seemed better than nothing

**Investor Interest**

- Low interest rates pushed capital toward tech startups
- "Disruption" narrative captured investor imagination
- Labor costs treated as friction to be eliminated
- Regulatory arbitrage seen as competitive advantage

### 2009-2012: The "Sharing Economy" Emerges

**Key Platform Launches**

| Platform | Founded | Initial Pitch |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Uber (UberCab) | 2009 | Black car service via app |
| Lyft (Zimride) | 2007/2012 | Peer-to-peer ridesharing |
| Airbnb | 2008 | Rent your spare room |
| TaskRabbit | 2008 | Outsource your errands |
| Instacart | 2012 | Someone else does your shopping |
| Postmates | 2011 | On-demand delivery |

**The "Sharing Economy" Frame**

Platforms marketed themselves as:

- Peer-to-peer, person-to-person
- Utilizing idle assets (cars, rooms)
- Creating "micro-entrepreneurs"
- Empowering individuals with flexibility
- Building community through sharing

**Reality vs. Rhetoric**

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "Sharing" | Commercial transactions; platform takes 20-30% |
| "Micro-entrepreneurs" | Economically dependent workers |
| "Flexibility" | Algorithmic control, unpredictable income |
| "Using idle assets" | Full-time workers in dedicated vehicles |
| "Platform" only | Platforms set prices, terms, access to work |

### 2013-2015: Uber Model Spreads

**Uber's Innovation**

Uber's core innovations were not technological but legal and economic:

1. **Misclassify at scale**: Treat all drivers as contractors despite control
2. **Use venture capital to subsidize prices**: Undercut regulated competitors
3. **Move fast, break laws**: Operate illegally until too big to ban
4. **Externalize costs**: Vehicle, fuel, insurance, benefits on workers

**The Uber Playbook**

| Step | Tactic |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Launch in city without permits or licenses |
| 2 | Recruit drivers with bonus incentives |
| 3 | Offer subsidized rides to build user base |
| 4 | Create political pressure from users against regulation |
| 5 | Lobby for legalization with platform-friendly rules |
| 6 | Once dominant, raise prices and cut driver pay |

**Spread to Other Sectors**

| Sector | Uber-for-X Examples |
|--------|---------------------|
| Delivery | DoorDash, Postmates, Caviar |
| Grocery | Instacart, Shipt |
| Cleaning | Handy, Homejoy |
| Moving | Dolly, Lugg |
| Laundry | Washio (failed) |
| Legal | LawTrades |
| Healthcare | Heal, Pager |
| Beauty | Glamsquad |

Many "Uber for X" companies failed, but the model persisted.

## Lessons from the Past

### What Platform Companies Learned

1. **Move fast, break things works**: Establish market position before regulation catches up
2. **Narrative matters**: "Sharing economy" framing neutralized early opposition
3. **User mobilization is powerful**: Rider/consumer pressure defeats regulatory resistance
4. **Ballot measures bypass legislatures**: Direct democracy can be purchased
5. **Arbitration blocks collective action**: Mandatory arbitration defeats lawsuits
6. **Divide workers**: Create internal competition, prevent solidarity

### What Workers Learned

1. **Flexibility is a trap**: Real flexibility requires power to say no
2. **Ratings systems control workers**: Stars replace supervisors
3. **Algorithmic opacity hides exploitation**: Can't fight what you can't see
4. **Collective action is essential**: Individual negotiation is impossible
5. **Legal fights are slow and uncertain**: Courts are not reliable allies
6. **Political power matters**: Must contest platforms on political terrain

### What Reformers Learned

1. **Platforms will spend unlimited money**: Must match resources or change arena
2. **ABC test works but triggers backlash**: Clear standards provoke political fights
3. **State-by-state is vulnerable**: Need federal solution
4. **International solidarity emerging**: Learn from global experiments
5. **Must address benefits gap**: Classification alone doesn't solve all problems
6. **Coalition building essential**: Unite gig workers with traditional labor, consumers
