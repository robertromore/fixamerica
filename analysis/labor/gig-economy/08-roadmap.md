# Gig Economy: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Reforming the gig economy requires a multi-track strategy that advances simultaneously on federal, state, and organizing fronts while building the political power necessary to overcome well-resourced platform opposition. This roadmap sequences reforms from immediately achievable to longer-term structural change.

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Years 1-2)

### Worker Organizing and Power Building
