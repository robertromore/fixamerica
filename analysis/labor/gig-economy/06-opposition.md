## Proposition 22 Case Study

### Background

**California AB5 (2019)**

- Codified ABC test for worker classification
- Presumption that workers are employees
- Applied to gig platforms (Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, etc.)
- Platforms refused to comply, threatened to leave California

**Platform Response**

Rather than comply with the law, platforms:

1. Continued misclassifying workers
2. Filed lawsuits challenging AB5
3. Spent over $200 million on ballot measure to exempt themselves

### Prop 22 Campaign

**Spending**

| Side | Amount | Source |
|------|-------:|--------|
| Yes on 22 (platforms) | $205.4 million | Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart, Postmates |
| No on 22 (labor) | $19.4 million | Unions, progressive groups |
| **Ratio** | **10.5:1** | Platforms outspent opponents |

**Most Expensive Ballot Measure in U.S. History**

The $205 million broke all records for California ballot measure spending.

**Tactics**

| Tactic | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Saturation advertising | TV, digital, radio, mail at unprecedented levels |
| In-app messaging | Push notifications to riders and drivers |
| Driver recruitment | Bonus offers tied to Prop 22 advocacy |
| Fear messaging | "You'll lose your gig if this fails" |
| Fake worker groups | Astroturf "driver" organizations |
| Celebrity endorsements | Paid influencer campaigns |
| Misleading claims | Overstated benefits, minimized downsides |

**Messaging**

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "Protects driver flexibility" | Platforms already controlled schedules |
| "Guarantees minimum earnings" | Only for "engaged time" (about 60% of work time) |
| "Provides healthcare stipend" | $1.17/hour, less than ACA coverage |
| "Creates new benefits" | Far less than employee benefits |
| "Drivers want this" | Polls showed mixed; campaign flooded media |

### Prop 22 Provisions

**What Prop 22 Actually Did**

| Provision | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| 120% minimum wage guarantee | Only for "engaged time," not waiting; excludes expenses |
| Healthcare stipend | $1.17/hour for those averaging 25+ hours/week |
| Accident insurance | Limited coverage, less than workers' comp |
| Anti-discrimination policy | Already required by law |
| Rest policy | Companies can still deactivate for not accepting trips |
| 7/8 majority to amend | Nearly impossible to change |

**Why It's a Bad Deal for Workers**

| Comparison | Employee Status | Prop 22 |
|------------|-----------------|---------|
| Minimum wage | All hours | Engaged time only |
| Expense reimbursement | Full | Limited mileage |
| Overtime | Required | None |
| Unemployment insurance | Covered | Not covered |
| Workers' compensation | Full | Limited insurance |
| Health benefits | Employer contribution | Small stipend |
| Paid sick leave | Required | None |
| Right to organize | Protected | Not protected |

### Legal Challenges

**Timeline**

| Date | Development |
|------|-------------|
| November 2020 | Prop 22 passes with 58% |
| January 2021 | SEIU files lawsuit challenging constitutionality |
| August 2021 | Alameda County judge rules Prop 22 unconstitutional |
| 2022-2023 | Appeals process |
| March 2024 | California Supreme Court partly upholds, partly strikes |

**Constitutional Issues**

| Issue | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Legislature's plenary power | Prop 22 improperly limits |
| Workers' compensation | Cannot be bargained away by initiative |
| 7/8 supermajority | Unprecedented, potentially unconstitutional |
| Single-subject rule | Multiple topics in one measure |

### Lessons from Prop 22

**For Platforms**

- Direct democracy can be purchased
- Overwhelming spending advantage can determine outcomes
- Worker classification can be exempted ballot-by-ballot
- Fear messaging works with economically vulnerable workers

**For Reformers**

- Cannot match platform spending through traditional fundraising
- Need strategies that don't depend on money: coalition, narrative, organizing
- Must contest platforms on political terrain, not just legal
- State-by-state battles are resource-intensive and uncertain
- Federal solution more efficient but politically harder

## Lobbying and Political Spending

### Federal Lobbying

**Annual Lobbying Expenditures**

| Company | 2023 Lobbying |
|---------|-------------:|
| Uber | $4.0+ million |
| Lyft | $2.5+ million |
| DoorDash | $3.0+ million |
| Amazon | $21+ million (includes all issues) |
| Instacart | $1.5+ million |
| **Total (major platforms)** | **$30+ million** |

**Lobbying Targets**

| Target | Issues |
|--------|--------|
| DOL | Worker classification rules |
| IRS | Employment tax treatment |
| Congress | PRO Act opposition, portable benefits framing |
| FTC | Algorithmic regulation |
| NLRB | Joint employer, organizing rights |

### State Lobbying

**State-Level Spending**

| Focus | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| Classification laws | Block ABC test adoption |
| Wage standards | Oppose minimum wage floors |
| Benefits mandates | Defeat portable benefits requirements |
| Preemption | State preemption of local ordinances |
| Prop 22 replication | Export California model to other states |

**State-by-State Battles**

| State | Platform Position |
|-------|-------------------|
| Massachusetts | Fought AG lawsuit; settled 2024 |
| New York | Opposed delivery minimum wage |
| Washington | Negotiated weakened protections |
| Minnesota | Opposed minimum standards (implemented anyway) |
| Illinois | Negotiated exemptions |

### Campaign Contributions

**Political Giving**

| Recipient Type | Pattern |
|----------------|---------|
| Both parties | Platforms donate to both sides |
| Key committee members | Labor, commerce committees |
| Swing votes | Moderate Democrats |
| State legislators | Where classification battles occur |
| Local officials | Where city regulations threaten |

**PAC Activity**

- Platform PACs donate to candidates in both parties
- Focus on legislators with jurisdiction over labor issues
- State-level giving particularly intensive during legislative battles

## Legal Strategies

### Challenging Classification Laws

**AB5 Litigation**

| Case | Status |
|------|--------|
| California Trucking Association v. Bonta | Challenged AB5 application to trucking |
| Olson v. California | Constitutional challenge |
| Multiple platform-specific challenges | Ongoing |

**Federal Rule Litigation**

- Platforms challenging 2024 DOL independent contractor rule
- Coalition with business groups
- Seeking preliminary injunctions

### Arbitration as Defense

**Mandatory Arbitration Clauses**

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Block class actions | Workers can't aggregate claims |
| Force individual cases | Each worker must file separately |
| Platform-selected arbitrators | Structural bias toward repeat players |
| Confidentiality | Patterns of abuse stay hidden |
| Cost barrier | Most workers can't pursue claims |

**Supreme Court Support**

- *Epic Systems v. Lewis* (2018): Upheld class action waivers
- Conservative majority favors arbitration
- Difficult to legislatively override

### Preemption Arguments

**Federal Preemption Claims**

| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Federal transportation law preempts state labor law | Generally rejected |
| ERISA preempts state benefits mandates | Limited application |
| FAA preempts arbitration restrictions | Often successful |

**State Preemption**

Platforms push state legislatures to preempt local:

- Minimum wage laws
- Scheduling regulations
- Benefits requirements
- Classification standards

## Messaging and Narratives

### Platform Framing

**Core Narratives**

| Narrative | Message |
|-----------|---------|
| Flexibility | "Drivers value setting their own schedules" |
| Innovation | "Don't let outdated regulations kill innovation" |
| Opportunity | "We create economic opportunity" |
| Choice | "Workers choose to be independent" |
| Technology | "We're a technology company, not a transportation company" |
| Consumer benefit | "Regulation will raise prices and reduce service" |

**Counter-Facts**

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Flexibility | Algorithms control work access; flexibility is illusory |
| Innovation | Europe has platforms with worker protections |
| Opportunity | Many workers earn below minimum wage |
| Choice | Economic desperation, not genuine choice |
| Technology | Platforms provide transportation services |
| Prices | Prices are artificially low due to exploitation |

### Fear Tactics

**Threats**

| Threat | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "We'll leave your state" | Rarely follow through; market too valuable |
| "Prices will skyrocket" | Modest increases, not catastrophic |
| "Service will disappear" | Other markets have adjusted |
| "Jobs will be lost" | Drivers still needed; work continues |
| "You'll lose your gig" | Workers lose if platforms exploit them |

**App-Based Pressure**

| Tactic | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| In-app messages | Frighten drivers about regulation |
| Push notifications | Mobilize riders against reform |
| Email campaigns | Reach entire user base |
| Social media | Amplify fear messaging |

## Divide-and-Conquer Strategies

### Splitting Workers

**Creating Internal Divisions**

| Tactic | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Highlight high earners | Suggest regulation hurts "successful" drivers |
| Flexibility narrative | Part-time workers may fear losing flexibility |
| Multi-apping | Divided loyalties across platforms |
| Rating systems | Workers compete rather than cooperate |
| Geographic divisions | Different interests in different markets |

**Recruiting Worker Spokespeople**

- Find genuinely satisfied workers
- Provide platforms for anti-regulation message
- Fund "driver groups" that support platforms
- Feature in advertising and testimony

### Splitting Reformers

**Wedge Issues**

| Issue | Division |
|-------|----------|
| Full employee status vs. third category | Split between purists and pragmatists |
| Federal vs. state | Strategic disagreements |
| Portable benefits | May legitimize contractor status |
| Professional freelancers | Concern about over-regulation |

**Co-optation Attempts**

| Tactic | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Propose weak alternatives | Platform-designed "benefits" |
| Fund "reasonable" voices | Support for third-category compromises |
| Negotiate selectively | Divide coalition partners |
| Promise future improvements | Delay tactics |

## Why Opposition Succeeds

### Resource Asymmetry

| Resource | Platforms | Reformers |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Lobbying budget | $50+ million/year | $5 million/year (all unions combined) |
| Ballot measure spending | $200+ million | $20 million |
| Legal teams | Top-tier firms | Public interest lawyers |
| PR capacity | Massive | Limited |
| Research funding | Fund favorable studies | Rely on academic independence |

### Structural Advantages

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Concentrated interest | Platforms care intensely; public interest diffuse |
| Speed | Platforms move faster than regulation |
| Scale | National operations vs. state/local reform |
| Data | Know more about their business than regulators |
| Regulatory complexity | Exploit ambiguity and loopholes |

### Political Dynamics

| Dynamic | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Both parties receive donations | Bipartisan caution about reform |
| Consumer voter base | Politicians fear rider backlash |
| Innovation narrative | Tech exceptionalism persists |
| Federalism | State-by-state battles exhaust reformers |
| Court composition | Conservative judiciary favors business |
