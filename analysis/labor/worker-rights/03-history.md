# Worker Rights: History

## Origins of Employment-at-Will

### English Common Law Roots

- Master-servant relationship presumed yearly hiring
- Notice required for termination
- Reasonable cause expected

### American Divergence (1870s-1890s)

- **1877**: Horace Wood's treatise articulated at-will rule
- Claimed (incorrectly) this was established American law
- Courts adopted rule without historical basis
- Reflected Gilded Age ideology of "freedom of contract"
- Lochner era courts struck down worker protections

### Consolidation (1900-1930s)

- At-will became entrenched default rule
- Union contracts provided only protection
- Courts hostile to legislative intervention
- Workers had few legal protections

## New Deal and Statutory Rights

### National Labor Relations Act (1935)

- Protected right to organize
- Prohibited retaliation for union activity
- Created first major exception to at-will

### Fair Labor Standards Act (1938)

- Established minimum wage, overtime
- Retaliation for complaints prohibited

### Post-War Expansion

- **1963**: Equal Pay Act
- **1964**: Title VII (race, sex, religion, national origin)
- **1967**: Age Discrimination in Employment Act
- **1970**: OSHA (safety complaint retaliation)
- **1974**: ERISA (pension/benefit retaliation)

## Civil Rights Era Protections

### Title VII Framework

- Prohibited discrimination in employment
- Created EEOC enforcement
- Burden-shifting proof framework
- Pattern and practice suits

### Expansion of Protected Classes

- Pregnancy (1978)
- Disability (1990 ADA)
- Genetic information (2008 GINA)
- Sexual orientation/gender identity (2020 *Bostock*)

### Limitations

- Individual filing requirement
- EEOC resource constraints
- Burden on worker to prove intent
- Caps on damages (1991)

## Erosion of Worker Rights (1980s-Present)

### Rise of Mandatory Arbitration

- **1991**: *Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane* - Age discrimination claims arbitrable
- **2001**: *Circuit City v. Adams* - FAA covers employment contracts
- **2011**: *AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion* - Class action waivers enforceable
- **2018**: *Epic Systems v. Lewis* - Class waivers in employment valid

### Spread of Non-Competes

- Originally for executives with trade secrets
- 1990s-2000s: Expanded to all workers
- Used as retention tool
- Often signed without negotiation or consideration

### Whistleblower Retaliation

- Sarbanes-Oxley (2002): Securities fraud protection
- Dodd-Frank (2010): Enhanced SEC whistleblower program
- ACA (2010): Healthcare fraud protection
- Patchwork remains incomplete

## Recent Developments

### State-Level Innovation

- **2019**: Several states ban non-competes for low-wage workers
- **2020**: California leads on worker classification (AB5)
- **2022**: More states adopt fair workweek laws
- **2023**: FTC proposes nationwide non-compete ban

### Federal Action

- **2022**: Speak Out Act (limits NDAs in harassment cases)
- **2022**: Pregnant Workers Fairness Act
- **2023**: FTC non-compete rulemaking
- NLRB expanding Section 7 protections

### Supreme Court Trends

- Generally pro-employer on arbitration
- Narrow reading of anti-retaliation protections
- *Bostock* (2020) expanded Title VII to LGBTQ+
- Ongoing debates over NLRA preemption

## Comparative Historical Development

### European Model

- Post-WWII: Comprehensive just-cause protections
- Worker councils and codetermination
- Strong dismissal protections
- Integration with social insurance

### American Exceptionalism

- No comprehensive employment protection law
- Patchwork of specific statutory protections
- Heavy reliance on individual litigation
- Market-based flexibility prioritized
