# Worker Rights: Current State

## Employment-at-Will Doctrine

### Legal Framework

The default rule in 49 states (all except Montana):

- Employers can terminate for any reason not explicitly prohibited
- Employees can quit at any time
- No requirement for notice, explanation, or severance
- Burden on worker to prove illegal motivation

### Limited Exceptions

Courts have carved out narrow exceptions:

| Exception | Description | States Recognizing |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Public policy | Cannot fire for refusing illegal act | 43 states |
| Implied contract | Handbook language may create expectations | 38 states |
| Good faith | Cannot fire to avoid paying earned benefits | 11 states |
| Statutory | Anti-discrimination, retaliation statutes | All states |

### Montana Exception

Montana's Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act (1987):

- Requires just cause after probationary period
- Caps damages at 4 years lost wages
- Creates exclusive remedy (no punitive damages)
- Only comprehensive just-cause law in U.S.

## Wrongful Termination Claims

### Volume and Outcomes

- 90,000+ discrimination charges filed with EEOC annually
- 56% include retaliation claims
- Only 18% of EEOC charges result in merit resolution
- Average litigation takes 2-3 years
- Median jury verdict: $200,000; median settlement: $40,000
- Plaintiff win rate at trial: 15-30%

### Barriers to Justice

- **Cost**: Average employment case costs $50,000-$200,000 to litigate
- **Time**: Multi-year process while unemployed
- **Arbitration**: 60+ million workers must arbitrate, not litigate
- **Caps**: Statutory damages caps limit recovery
- **Proof**: Worker must prove discriminatory/retaliatory intent

## Whistleblower Protections

### Federal Framework

50+ federal whistleblower statutes with inconsistent protections:

| Statute | Coverage | Filing Deadline | Burden of Proof |
|---------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Sarbanes-Oxley | Securities fraud | 180 days | Contributing factor |
| Dodd-Frank | SEC violations | 6 years | Independent action |
| False Claims Act | Government fraud | 6 years | Qui tam (share recovery) |
| OSHA 11(c) | Safety violations | 30 days | Preponderance |
| ACA | Healthcare fraud | 180 days | Contributing factor |

### Outcomes

- OSHA whistleblower programs: 21% win rate
- Average processing time: 300+ days
- Many claims dismissed on procedural grounds
- Retaliation often subtle and hard to prove

## Non-Compete Agreements

### Prevalence

- 18% of all workers currently bound by non-competes
- 38% have signed one at some point in career
- Common even in low-wage sectors:
  - Fast food workers
  - Hair stylists
  - Security guards
  - Warehouse workers

### State Approaches

| Approach | States | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Generally enforceable | 35 states | Reasonable scope required |
| Banned for low-wage | 12 states | Income threshold varies |
| Largely banned | California, Oklahoma, North Dakota | Generally unenforceable |
| FTC proposed rule | Federal | Would ban most non-competes |

### Economic Effects

Research shows non-competes:

- Reduce worker mobility by 8-10%
- Suppress wages 4-8%
- Reduce entrepreneurship rates
- May reduce innovation and knowledge diffusion

## Workplace Surveillance

### Current Practices

80% of large employers engage in some monitoring:

| Type | Prevalence | Legal Status |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Email monitoring | 60% | Generally legal |
| Internet use | 66% | Generally legal |
| Video surveillance | 50% | Legal with notice (varies) |
| GPS tracking | 30% | Legal for company vehicles |
| Keystroke logging | 25% | Generally legal |
| Social media monitoring | 48% | Legal with limits |
| Biometric data | 15% | State laws vary |

### Legal Framework

- No comprehensive federal employee privacy law
- Electronic Communications Privacy Act (1986): Largely permits employer monitoring
- State laws vary; few protect workplace communications
- NLRA protects some concerted activity communications
- Three states (IL, TX, WA) regulate biometric data

## Scheduling Practices

### Problems

- 17% of workforce has irregular schedules
- 40% of hourly workers learn schedule less than 1 week in advance
- "Just-in-time" scheduling reduces hours without notice
- "Clopening" shifts (close then open) common in retail/food service
- On-call scheduling without pay

### Fair Workweek Laws

8 jurisdictions have passed predictable scheduling laws:

- Oregon (statewide)
- Seattle
- San Francisco
- New York City
- Philadelphia
- Chicago
- Los Angeles
- Emeryville, CA

Typical requirements:

- 14 days advance notice
- Predictability pay for changes
- Right to rest between shifts
- Right to request schedule changes

## Mandatory Arbitration

### Prevalence

- 60+ million workers subject to mandatory arbitration
- 56% of non-union private sector workers
- Near-universal in some industries (finance, tech)
- Often paired with class action waivers

### Outcomes

- Workers win 21% of arbitration cases (vs. 36% in court)
- Average arbitration award: $36,500 (vs. $176,000 in court)
- 98% of workers don't pursue claims in arbitration
- Repeat player advantage for employers

## International Comparison

| Country | Termination Protection | Notice Required |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------|
| United States | At-will (most states) | None required |
| United Kingdom | Just cause after 2 years | 1-12 weeks |
| Germany | Just cause always | 4 weeks-7 months |
| France | Just cause always | 1-2 months |
| Japan | Just cause effectively required | 30 days |
