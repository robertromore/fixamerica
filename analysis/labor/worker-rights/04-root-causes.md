# Worker Rights: Root Causes

## Why American Workers Have Fewer Rights

### 1. Historical Path Dependence

**At-Will Doctrine Entrenchment**

- Horace Wood's 1877 treatise invented the rule
- Courts adopted without questioning historical basis
- Became embedded in legal education and practice
- Now requires affirmative legislation to change

**Constitutional Framework**

- No constitutional right to employment
- Commerce Clause limits on federal regulation
- State-by-state approach creates race to bottom
- Courts historically hostile to worker protections

### 2. Power Imbalance

**Declining Union Density**

- Union contracts provide just-cause protections
- Only 6% private sector unionization
- Most workers lack collective power
- Individual negotiation disadvantages workers

**Information Asymmetry**

- Workers often unaware of rights
- Complex legal requirements deter claims
- Employer control of evidence
- Fear of retaliation suppresses complaints

**At-Will Culture**

- Workers accept vulnerability as normal
- "Be grateful you have a job" mentality
- High turnover normalized
- Little expectation of job security

### 3. Employer Advantages in Legal System

**Arbitration System**

- Employers design arbitration clauses
- Choose arbitration providers
- Repeat player advantage
- Class action waivers prevent collective action

**Litigation Barriers**

- High cost of employment litigation
- Contingency lawyers selective in cases
- Long timelines (2-3 years)
- Difficult proof requirements

**EEOC Resource Constraints**

- 67,000+ charges annually with limited staff
- Cannot investigate most complaints thoroughly
- Issues right-to-sue letters rather than prosecuting
- Backlog of cases

### 4. Political Economy

**Business Lobbying**

- Chamber of Commerce opposes worker protections
- SHRM (HR professionals) opposes regulations
- Industry-specific lobbying (non-competes)
- Campaign contributions influence policy

**Ideological Frameworks**

- "Free market" opposition to regulation
- "Flexibility" framed as benefiting workers
- Individual responsibility narrative
- Anti-government sentiment

**Federalism Barriers**

- ERISA preempts many state laws
- Federal minimum creates low floor
- State competition for business
- Local preemption by state legislatures

### 5. Legal Structure Problems

**Burden of Proof**

- Worker must prove illegal motive
- Employer can articulate any legitimate reason
- Pretext difficult to establish
- Smoking gun rarely exists

**Remedies Limitations**

- Title VII caps compensatory/punitive damages
- Reinstatement rarely effective remedy
- Attorney fee awards inadequate
- No meaningful deterrence

**Enforcement Gaps**

- EEOC underfunded
- DOL enforcement limited
- State agencies understaffed
- Private enforcement barriers

### 6. Specific Issue Drivers

**Non-Compete Proliferation**

- No federal regulation
- State enforcement varies widely
- Low cost to include in contracts
- Chilling effect even if unenforceable
- Used to suppress wages

**Surveillance Expansion**

- Technology makes monitoring cheap
- No comprehensive privacy law
- Employer property rights prevail
- Productivity monitoring normalized
- Work-from-home expanded surveillance

**Scheduling Unpredictability**

- Just-in-time inventory applied to labor
- Software optimizes employer scheduling
- Retail/service industry norm
- Workers bear demand fluctuation risk

### 7. Gaps in Protection

**Coverage Holes**

| Category | Gap |
|----------|-----|
| Small employers | Title VII excludes <15 employees |
| Independent contractors | Most laws don't apply |
| Probationary workers | Montana exception has probation period |
| Religious employers | Ministerial exception broadened |
| Domestic workers | Often excluded from protections |

**Procedural Barriers**

- Short filing deadlines (30-300 days)
- Exhaustion requirements
- Administrative prerequisites
- Statute of limitations issues

### 8. Cultural Factors

**American Work Ethic**

- Work as identity
- Loyalty expected without reciprocity
- Job insecurity as motivation
- Resistance to "European" protections

**Individual Responsibility Frame**

- Workers blamed for job loss
- Skills mismatch narrative
- Market outcomes seen as fair
- Collective solutions suspect
