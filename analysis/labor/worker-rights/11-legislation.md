**Draft Text**:

```
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that:
(a) The employment-at-will doctrine leaves 100 million American workers 
    vulnerable to arbitrary termination;
(b) The United States is an outlier among developed nations in lacking 
    basic termination protections;
(c) Just-cause standards promote fair treatment, reduce discrimination, 
    and improve economic security.

SEC. 3. JUST CAUSE STANDARD.
(a) COVERED EMPLOYERS.—This section applies to employers with 15 or 
    more employees.

    employee who has completed the probationary period except for 
    just cause.

    from the date of hire.
(d) JUST CAUSE DEFINED.—Just cause includes:
    (1) Unsatisfactory job performance documented through progressive 
        discipline;
    (2) Serious misconduct including dishonesty, insubordination, or 
        violation of workplace rules;
    (3) Economic necessity requiring reduction in workforce, provided 
        such reductions are made in good faith.

SEC. 4. PROCEDURES.
(a) WRITTEN NOTICE.—An employer terminating an employee shall provide 
    written notice stating the reason for termination.
(b) PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE.—For performance-based terminations, 
    employers must demonstrate progressive discipline unless the 
    conduct constitutes gross misconduct.

SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT.
(a) PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.—Any employee terminated in violation of 
    this Act may bring a civil action.
(b) REMEDIES.—Remedies shall include reinstatement, back pay with

(a) FTC ENFORCEMENT.—The Federal Trade Commission shall enforce this 
    Act as an unfair method of competition.
(b) PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.—Workers may bring civil actions for 
    violations, with remedies including actual damages, $5,000

SEC. 6. PREEMPTION.

non-compete agreements, except that states may provide greater 
worker protections.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Independent contractor misclassification | Employers classify workers as contractors to avoid protections | High |
| Small employer exemption | 15-employee threshold excludes millions | Medium |
| Probationary period manipulation | Employers terminate before probation ends | Medium |
| Documentation gaming | Employers create pretextual documentation | Medium |
| Trade secret exception abuse | Non-compete ban exception exploited | Low |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Enforcement resources | Underfunded agencies cannot enforce | Budget constraints |
| Proof requirements | Difficult to prove employer motive | Evidence asymmetry |
| Litigation costs | Many workers cannot afford to pursue claims | Access to justice |
| Retaliation during litigation | Workers face ongoing harm while pursuing claims | Slow process |
| Federal preemption gaps | ERISA and other laws limit state innovation | Federal structure |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Address misclassification**: Pair with strong ABC test for worker classification
2. **Lower thresholds**: Reduce employer size threshold to 5 employees over time
3. **Anti-gaming provisions**: Prohibit termination in final week of probation without cause; pattern evidence allowed
4. **Strengthen documentation standards**: Require contemporaneous documentation; penalize fabrication
5. **Limit trade secret exception**: Require specific identification of trade secrets; time limits on restrictions
6. **Fund enforcement**: Mandatory funding formula tied to covered employment
7. **Burden shifting**: Once prima facie case shown, employer bears burden
8. **Fee shifting**: Prevailing plaintiffs receive attorney fees
9. **Expedited process**: Preliminary injunctions available; expedited hearings
10. **Close preemption gaps**: Explicit savings clauses preserving state innovation

### General Implementation Concerns

- **Business compliance**: Phase in requirements; provide compliance assistance
- **Small business impact**: Consider tiered requirements by employer size
- **Economic conditions**: Build in flexibility for documented economic necessity
- **Regional variation**: Allow state enhancement above federal floor
- **Political sustainability**: Start with most popular reforms (non-competes) to build momentum
