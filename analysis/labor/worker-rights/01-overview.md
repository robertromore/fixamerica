# Worker Rights: Overview

## Executive Summary

American workers have fewer legal protections than workers in any other developed democracy. The employment-at-will doctrine—allowing termination for any reason not explicitly prohibited by law—leaves 74% of private sector workers vulnerable to arbitrary dismissal. Weak whistleblower protections, expansive non-compete agreements, pervasive workplace surveillance, and unpredictable scheduling compound worker vulnerability. This subtopic examines the legal framework governing worker rights and proposes reforms to establish baseline protections.

## Scope

This subtopic covers legal protections for workers beyond wages and collective bargaining:

- **Employment security**: At-will doctrine, just cause, wrongful termination
- **Retaliation protection**: Whistleblowers, complainants, organizers
- **Contract restrictions**: Non-competes, NDAs, arbitration clauses
- **Workplace privacy**: Surveillance, monitoring, personal data
- **Scheduling**: Predictability, advance notice, fair workweek
- **Anti-discrimination**: Title VII, ADA, ADEA enforcement
- **Information rights**: Access to personnel files, pay transparency

## Key Facts

- **At-will employment**: 74% of private sector workers can be fired without cause; only Montana requires just cause
- **Non-competes**: 18% of workers bound by non-compete agreements, including 14% of workers earning under $40,000
- **Retaliation**: Fastest-growing EEOC charge category, comprising 56% of all charges in 2022
- **Surveillance**: 80% of large employers monitor employee communications or activities
- **Wrongful termination**: Average case takes 2+ years to resolve; median settlement $40,000
- **Whistleblowers**: Only 21% of whistleblowers who file with OSHA win their cases
- **Arbitration**: 60+ million workers subject to mandatory arbitration clauses

## Key Questions

- Should American workers have just-cause protection against arbitrary termination?
- How can whistleblowers be protected from retaliation?
- Should non-compete agreements be banned or restricted?
- What limits should exist on workplace surveillance?
- How can workers access justice when rights are violated?
- What role should class actions vs. individual arbitration play?

## Relationship to Other Subtopics

Worker rights intersect with other labor issues:

- **Unions** ([unions/](../unions/01-overview.md)): Collective bargaining provides contractual rights protections
- **Collective Bargaining** ([collective-bargaining/](../collective-bargaining/01-overview.md)): Union contracts typically include just-cause provisions
- **Wage Theft** ([wage-theft/](../wage-theft/01-overview.md)): Workers fear retaliation for reporting violations
- **Gig Economy** ([gig-economy/](../gig-economy/01-overview.md)): Classification determines which protections apply
