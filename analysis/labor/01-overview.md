# Labor: Overview

## Executive Summary

American workers face a crisis of power, protection, and prosperity. Union membership has collapsed from 35% in the 1950s to 10% today, leaving most workers without collective voice. The federal minimum wage hasn't been raised since 2009, wage theft extracts $15-50 billion annually from workers, and the gig economy has created a new class of workers without basic protections. Meanwhile, workplace safety enforcement remains inadequate, paid leave is unavailable to millions, and retirement security is increasingly precarious. This domain analyzes the structural causes of labor market dysfunction and proposes comprehensive reforms to restore worker power and protection.

## Scope

This domain covers the full spectrum of labor relations and worker protections:

- **Collective action**: Union organizing, collective bargaining, strikes
- **Workplace standards**: Minimum wage, overtime, wage theft enforcement
- **Working conditions**: Safety, paid leave, scheduling, surveillance
- **Worker classification**: Employee vs. contractor, gig economy
- **Economic security**: Retirement, benefits portability
- **Skills development**: Workforce training, apprenticeships
- **Legal rights**: Termination protection, whistleblowing, anti-retaliation

## Key Facts

- **Union density**: 10.1% overall, 6% private sector (down from 35% in 1954)
- **Minimum wage**: Federal $7.25/hour since 2009 (40% below 1968 peak in real terms)
- **Wage theft**: $15-50 billion stolen annually, exceeding all property crime combined
- **Gig economy**: 59 million Americans do freelance work; many misclassified
- **Workplace deaths**: 5,500+ fatalities annually; OSHA has 750 inspectors for 8 million workplaces
- **Paid leave**: U.S. is only OECD country without federal paid leave mandate
- **Retirement crisis**: 50% of households have no retirement savings; median near-retiree has $12,000

## Key Questions

- Why has union density collapsed and what would reverse it?
- How can workers be protected in the gig economy?
- What would it take to eliminate wage theft?
- How can workplace safety be meaningfully enforced?
- What role should government play in setting workplace standards?
- How can retirement security be achieved for all workers?
- What would a modern system of worker voice look like?

## Core Tensions

### Flexibility vs. Security

Employers value workforce flexibility; workers need income security. Gig economy exemplifies this tension: platforms offer flexibility but shift all risk to workers. Resolution requires portable benefits and baseline protections that don't depend on employment relationship.

### Federal Standards vs. State Competition

Federal minimum standards prevent race to bottom but may not fit all labor markets. State variation allows experimentation but creates uneven protections. Balance requires strong federal floor with state ability to exceed.

### Employer Power vs. Worker Voice

Declining unionization has shifted power dramatically toward employers. Restoring balance requires either union revitalization or alternative voice mechanisms. Some propose sectoral bargaining, worker board representation, or enhanced individual rights.

### Short-Term Costs vs. Long-Term Benefits

Higher wages, better benefits, and stronger protections impose immediate costs on employers. Evidence suggests these investments pay returns through reduced turnover, higher productivity, and greater consumer spending. Political challenge is bridging temporal gap.

## What Success Looks Like

- **Living wages**: All workers earning enough to meet basic needs without public assistance
- **Worker voice**: Meaningful representation in workplace decisions, whether through unions or alternatives
- **Safe workplaces**: Zero preventable deaths; robust enforcement of standards
- **Portable benefits**: Healthcare, retirement, leave accessible regardless of employment status
- **Work-life balance**: Paid leave universal; predictable schedules standard
- **Skills access**: Lifelong learning available to all workers
- **Enforcement**: Labor laws actually enforced with meaningful penalties
