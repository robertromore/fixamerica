# Workforce Development: Root Causes

## Why the U.S. Underinvests in Workforce Development

### 1. Fragmented System Structure

**Multiple Funding Streams**

- 40+ federal employment and training programs
- Different eligibility requirements
- Separate performance measures
- Conflicting incentives
- No coherent strategy

**Governance Complexity**

- Federal funding, state administration, local delivery
- Workforce boards with limited authority
- Multiple agencies involved
- Coordination failures

**Education-Workforce Divide**

- Department of Education vs. Department of Labor
- Community colleges disconnected from workforce system
- K-12 disconnected from career pathways
- No integrated system

### 2. Chronic Underfunding

**Declining Investment**

| Year | WIOA/WIA (Inflation-Adjusted) |
|------|------------------------------|
| 2000 | $6.5 billion |
| 2010 | $4.5 billion |
| 2020 | $3.5 billion |

**Comparison to Need**

- Millions of displaced workers annually
- Only hundreds of thousands receive training
- Average WIOA expenditure: $3,000 per participant
- Quality training costs $10,000-$30,000

**Compared to Other Countries**

- U.S. spends 0.1% of GDP on active labor market policies
- OECD average: 0.5%
- Denmark: 1.5%

### 3. Employer Underinvestment

**Market Failures**

- **Poaching problem**: Firms that train workers lose them to non-training competitors
- **Short-term focus**: Quarterly earnings pressure discourages long-term investment
- **Externalities**: Benefits of training extend beyond individual firm

**Structural Issues**

- Low unionization reduces joint training programs
- High turnover makes investment risky
- Small firms lack resources
- Subcontracting shifts training to workers

**Cultural Factors**

- "Hire skills, don't build them" mentality
- Preference for experienced workers
- College degree as screening device
- Undervaluing non-degree credentials

### 4. Misaligned Incentives

**Performance Metrics**

- WIOA measures job placement, not quality
- Encourages "creaming" (serving easiest-to-employ)
- Short-term metrics miss long-term gains
- Training completion not prioritized

**Provider Incentives**

- Community colleges rewarded for enrollment, not completion
- Training providers lack skin in the game
- No penalties for poor outcomes
- Credential mills can profit

**Political Incentives**

- Training invisible compared to direct job creation
- Benefits long-term, costs immediate
- Constituents don't demand workforce investment
- Easy to cut in budget negotiations

### 5. Apprenticeship Barriers

**Employer Costs**

- Training costs borne primarily by employers
- No tax incentives (unlike equipment investment)
- Regulatory complexity
- Liability concerns

**Cultural Barriers**

- "College for all" ideology
- Apprenticeship stigmatized as second-class
- Parents prefer college pathway
- Career counselors don't promote apprenticeships

**Structural Barriers**

- Weak intermediary institutions
- No strong employer associations to organize training
- Union decline reduced joint programs
- No comprehensive standards framework

### 6. Systemic Disconnections

**Employer-Educator Gap**

- Curricula lag industry needs
- Faculty lack current industry knowledge
- Employers don't communicate needs clearly
- Timing mismatches (training vs. hiring cycles)

**K-12 to Postsecondary**

- Career exploration limited
- Vocational stigma
- Tracking concerns
- No clear pathways

**Training to Job**

- Credentials not recognized by employers
- Geographic mismatches
- Hiring practices ignore non-degree credentials
- Networking disadvantages for training completers

### 7. Population-Specific Barriers

**Displaced Workers**

- Geographic attachment to declining areas
- Age discrimination
- Skills depreciation
- Inadequate income support during training

**Low-Income Workers**

- Cannot afford time out of work
- Child care, transportation barriers
- Basic skills gaps
- Work requirements conflict with training

**Incumbent Workers**

- Employer resistance to training time
- Evening/weekend programs limited
- Online quality variable
- No right to training leave

### 8. Information Failures

**Workers Lack Information On**

- Which credentials have labor market value
- Quality of training providers
- Job market demand
- Career pathway options

**Employers Lack Information On**

- Skill content of credentials
- Quality of training providers
- Competencies of credential holders
- Available subsidies and programs
