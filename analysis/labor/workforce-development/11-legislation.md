## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Quality gaming | Providers optimize for metrics, not outcomes | Medium |
| Creaming | Serving easiest-to-employ participants | High |
| Credential inflation | Credentials without labor market value proliferate | Medium |
| Employer free-riding | Employers benefit without contributing | Medium |
| Displacement definition gaming | Employers restructure to avoid coverage | Low |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Insufficient funding | Scale doesn't match need | Political will, budget constraints |
| Employer engagement | Training disconnected from hiring | Coordination failures |
| Credential proliferation | Workers can't assess value | Market failures, information gaps |
| Geographic disparities | Rural areas underserved | Infrastructure costs |
| Long-term sustainability | Programs end when grants end | Funding structure |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Address creaming**: Weight performance measures for harder-to-serve; require representative enrollment
2. **Credential quality**: Require outcome reporting; publish labor market value data; limit Pell eligibility to proven programs
3. **Employer contribution**: Require matching funds; prioritize committed employers; consider training levy
4. **Sustain investment**: Multi-year appropriations; dedicated funding source; state maintenance of effort
5. **Rural access**: Distance learning investments; mobile training; regional consortia
6. **Strengthen intermediaries**: Fund industry associations; build nonprofit capacity; support union training programs
7. **Improve data**: Linked education-workforce data systems; transparent outcome reporting; credential registry
8. **Prevent gaming**: Multiple measures; audit systems; qualitative assessment
9. **Support participation**: Child care, transportation, living expenses covered; flexible scheduling
10. **Ensure quality**: Accreditation standards; outcome minimums; consumer protection

### General Implementation Concerns

- **Coordination**: Multiple agencies must work together effectively
- **Capacity**: Workforce system capacity needs building
- **Employer engagement**: Requires sustained relationship-building
- **Political sustainability**: Funding vulnerable to budget cuts
- **Quality-access tension**: Standards may limit access; balance needed
