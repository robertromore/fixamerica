## Key Lessons from History

### What Has Worked

- **Apprenticeships**: High completion, strong earnings gains
- **Sector strategies**: Employer engagement improves outcomes
- **Comprehensive services**: Wrap-around support matters
- **GI Bill model**: Adequate funding, clear benefits, worker choice

### What Has Not Worked

- **Quick fixes**: Short-term training produces modest results
- **Supply-side only**: Training without employer demand fails
- **Fragmentation**: Multiple programs create confusion
- **Underfunding**: Insufficient investment limits scale
- **Work first**: Rapid employment without skills limits advancement

### Persistent Challenges

- Scale never matched need
- Political support cyclical
- Employer engagement inconsistent
- Quality control difficult
- Serving hardest-to-employ costly
