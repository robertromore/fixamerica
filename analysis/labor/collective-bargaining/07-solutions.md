# Collective Bargaining: Solutions

## Overview

Reviving collective bargaining in America requires addressing its fundamental structural weaknesses: the enterprise model that requires winning at every workplace, the first contract problem, limited bargaining scope, and the collapse of strike power. Solutions range from reforms within the current framework to transformational changes like sectoral bargaining.

## First Contract Arbitration

### The Problem

- 30-37% of new unions never achieve a first contract
- Median time to first contract: 465 days
- Employers can delay indefinitely with minimal penalty
- Worker support erodes during prolonged bargaining

### The Solution

**Mandatory First Contract Arbitration**

| Phase | Timeline | Process |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Direct bargaining | 90 days | Parties negotiate directly |
| Mediation | 30 days | FMCS mediator assists |
| Interest arbitration | 45 days | Arbitrator imposes contract |

**Key Features**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Trigger | Either party can request |
| Timeline | Strict deadlines |
| Scope | Full contract terms |
| Duration | 2-year initial contract |
| Standards | Comparable contracts, employer capacity |

### Canadian Experience

First contract arbitration exists in most Canadian provinces:

| Province | First Contract Success Rate |
|----------|---------------------------|
| British Columbia | 92% within 2 years |
| Ontario | 89% within 2 years |
| Quebec | 87% within 2 years |
| United States (no FCA) | 63% within 2 years |

### Implementation

**Federal Level (PRO Act)**

The PRO Act includes first contract arbitration:

- 90-day direct bargaining period
- Mediation if no agreement
- Binding arbitration if mediation fails
- Two-year imposed contract

**State Level**

States could implement for:

- Public sector workers
- State-regulated industries
- Workers on state contracts

## Sectoral Bargaining

### The Concept

Instead of bargaining workplace by workplace, negotiate standards for entire industries:

**Comparison**

| Feature | Enterprise Bargaining | Sectoral Bargaining |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Unit | Single workplace | Entire industry |
| Coverage | Winning workers only | All workers in sector |
| Employer incentive | Fight hard to stay non-union | Leveled playing field |
| Organizing cost | Per-workplace | Amortized across sector |
| Competition | On wages | On other factors |

### International Models

**Nordic Model (Denmark, Sweden)**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Bargaining level | National and sectoral |
| Coverage | 80-90% |
| Union role | Negotiate with employer federations |
| Extension | Agreements set de facto standards |
| Enforcement | Strong union presence |

**German Model**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Sectoral agreements | Industry-wide contracts |
| Works councils | Firm-level representation |
| Codetermination | Workers on boards |
| Extension mechanism | Government can extend agreements |
| Coverage | 54% (declining) |

**French Model**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Union density | 8% |
| Bargaining coverage | 98% |
| Mechanism | Legal extension of sector agreements |
| Works councils | Mandatory above threshold |
| Government role | Active extension, enforcement |

### American Implementation

**Wage Boards**

Tripartite bodies setting industry standards:

| Composition | Role |
|-------------|------|
| Worker representatives | Propose standards |
| Employer representatives | Provide input |
| Public members | Balance, decide |
| Government staff | Research, administration |

**Existing Examples**

| Jurisdiction | Sector | Outcome |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| New York | Fast food | $15 minimum (first in US) |
| California | Fast food | $20 minimum (2024) |
| California | Healthcare | $25 minimum (phasing in) |
| Seattle | Hotel | $20.76 minimum |

**Expansion Potential**

| Sector | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Fast food | Large workforce, low wages |
| Home care | Medicaid-funded, government leverage |
| Hotels | Geographic concentration |
| Warehousing | Growing sector, safety issues |
| Janitorial | History of organizing |
| Retail | Massive workforce |

### Federal Sectoral Framework

**Proposed Structure**

| Level | Function |
|-------|----------|
| National | Basic standards, portability |
| Sectoral | Industry-specific wages, benefits |
| Enterprise | Supplemental agreements |

**Key Elements**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Industry determination | Define sectors by NAICS or similar |
| Representative selection | Unions, worker organizations |
| Employer participation | Associations or direct |
| Extension | Apply to all employers in sector |
| Enforcement | Government agencies, courts |

## Expanding Mandatory Subjects

### Current Limitations

Many critical workplace decisions are permissive subjects:

| Decision | Current Status | Worker Interest |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Plant closure | Permissive (effects only) | Job security |
| Subcontracting | Often permissive | Job security |
| Technology adoption | Permissive | Working conditions |
| Relocation | Permissive | Jobs, community |
| Investment decisions | Permissive | Long-term security |

### Proposed Expansion

**New Mandatory Subjects**

| Subject | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Subcontracting | Direct impact on workers |
| Technological change | Affects working conditions |
| Relocation decisions | Community and worker impact |
| Scheduling practices | Work-life balance |
| Discipline procedures | Fundamental fairness |
| Safety and health | Worker welfare |

**Legislative Approach**

Define mandatory subjects to include any employer decision that:

- Affects wages, hours, or working conditions
- Is within employer's control
- Has significant worker impact

## Strike Rights Restoration

### Current Limitations

**Permanent Replacement**

| Limitation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Economic strikers | Can be permanently replaced |
| Striker return rights | Only when vacancy |
| Replacement hiring | Immediately upon strike |

**Other Restrictions**

| Restriction | Source |
|-------------|--------|
| Secondary boycotts | Taft-Hartley |
| Sympathy strikes | Taft-Hartley |
| Hot cargo | Taft-Hartley |
| Public sector strikes | Most state laws |

### Proposed Reforms

**Ban Permanent Replacement**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Prohibition | Cannot permanently replace strikers |
| Temporary replacement | Allowed during strike |
| Striker return | Immediate upon strike end |
| Preferential rehiring | If positions eliminated |

**Restore Secondary Activity**

| Reform | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Repeal secondary boycott ban | Allow supply chain pressure |
| Allow hot cargo | Refuse non-union goods |
| Permit sympathy strikes | Solidarity action |

### Impact

Without permanent replacement:

- Strike threat becomes credible
- Employers must negotiate seriously
- Workers have real leverage
- Bargaining power restored

## Public Sector Reforms

### Federal Floor for Public Sector Bargaining

**The Problem**

| State Category | Number | Workers Affected |
|----------------|--------|------------------|
| No bargaining rights | 7 | Millions |
| Limited rights | 12 | Millions |
| Full rights | 31 | Millions |

**Proposed Solution: Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act**

| Provision | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Minimum rights | All public workers can organize |
| Bargaining scope | Wages, hours, conditions |
| Enforcement | Federal backstop |
| Strike rights | Vary by function |
| Savings clause | States can exceed |

### Post-Janus Solutions

**Internal Organizing**

| Strategy | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Convert fee payers to members | Maintain membership |
| Member engagement | Demonstrate value |
| Leadership development | Build commitment |
| Political education | Connect work to politics |

**Legislative Responses**

| State | Response |
|-------|----------|
| California | Protected payroll deduction |
| New York | Enhanced union access |
| New Jersey | Mandatory orientations |
| Washington | Expanded outreach rights |

### Interest Arbitration Expansion

**Current Use**

| Sector | Interest Arbitration |
|--------|---------------------|

| Other public workers | Less common |
| Private sector | Rare |

**Proposed Expansion**

Where strikes are prohibited, provide binding interest arbitration:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Trigger | Impasse after good faith bargaining |
| Selection | Tripartite panel or single arbitrator |
| Standards | Comparable wages, ability to pay |
| Timeline | 60-90 days |
| Binding | On both parties |

## Works Councils and Alternative Models

### Works Councils

**European Model**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Mandate | Required above threshold (50 employees) |
| Election | All employees vote |
| Rights | Information, consultation, co-determination |
| Relation to unions | Complementary |

**Potential U.S. Application**

| Element | Proposed |
|---------|----------|
| Threshold | 50+ employees |
| Election | All workers eligible |
| Rights | Information, consultation |
| Bargaining | Complements union bargaining |
| Independence | Must be worker-controlled |

**8(a)(2) Concerns**

Current law prohibits employer-dominated labor organizations. Reform needed to:

- Allow genuinely independent works councils
- Maintain prohibition on company unions
- Ensure worker control

### Minority Unions

**Current Limitation**

Unions without majority cannot compel bargaining.

**Proposed Rights**

| Right | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Members-only bargaining | Negotiate for members |
| Information rights | Access to relevant data |

| Working Washington | Worker organization |
| Restaurant Opportunities Centers | Industry advocacy |

### Pattern Bargaining Revival

**Historical Success**

Pattern bargaining extended union standards across industries:

| Industry | Pattern Leader | Coverage |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Auto | Big Three | Suppliers, others |
| Steel | Major producers | Industry-wide |
| Trucking | National Master | Major carriers |

**Modern Application**

| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Coordinate bargaining | Unions align expiration dates |
| Share information | Common data, analysis |
| Target setting | Lead employer sets pattern |
| Solidarity | Honor pattern or strike |
