# Collective Bargaining: Overview

## Executive Summary

Collective bargaining is the process through which workers, represented by unions, negotiate with employers over wages, benefits, and working conditions. In America, this right has been systematically weakened to the point where only 12% of workers are covered by collective bargaining agreements, compared to 80-90% in Nordic countries and over 50% in most developed democracies.

The decline of collective bargaining is both cause and consequence of broader labor movement collapse. When workers cannot effectively bargain, they lose the primary mechanism for claiming their share of economic gains. The result: productivity has increased 60% since 1979 while median wages have grown only 16%.

**The Coverage Gap**

| Metric | United States | Germany | Sweden | France |
|--------|---------------|---------|--------|--------|
| Collective bargaining coverage | 12% | 54% | 90% | 98% |
| Union membership | 10% | 17% | 65% | 8% |
| Workers with voice at work | ~12% | 80%+ | 90%+ | 98%+ |

The striking contrast between France's 8% union membership and 98% bargaining coverage illustrates a critical point: bargaining coverage can extend far beyond union membership through sectoral agreements and legal extensions.

## Why Collective Bargaining Matters

### The Wage Effect

Workers covered by collective bargaining agreements earn significantly more:

| Benefit | Union Premium |
|---------|---------------|
| Wages | 10-20% higher |
| Health insurance | 28% more likely to have coverage |
| Pension | 54% more likely to have defined benefit plan |
| Paid leave | Significantly more |
| Job security | Just cause protections |

### The Equality Effect

Collective bargaining compresses wage differentials:

| Measure | Strong Bargaining Countries | Weak Bargaining (US) |
|---------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| CEO-worker pay ratio | 20-50:1 | 350:1 |
| Gini coefficient | 0.25-0.28 | 0.39 |
| Share of income to top 1% | 8-10% | 20% |

Countries with stronger collective bargaining have lower inequality, higher median wages, and more shared prosperity.

### The Voice Effect

Collective bargaining gives workers voice over:

- Working hours and schedules
- Safety conditions
- Discipline and termination procedures
- Training and advancement
- Workplace technology implementation
- Management practices

Without collective bargaining, these decisions are made unilaterally by employers.

## Scope of This Analysis

This subtopic covers the collective bargaining process specifically:

- **Coverage and scope**: Who is covered, what can be bargained
- **Public vs. private sector**: Different legal frameworks
- **The first contract problem**: Why 30% of new unions never reach a contract
- **Strike rights**: Limitations and restrictions
- **Bargaining models**: Enterprise, sectoral, and pattern bargaining
- **Alternative models**: Works councils, co-determination
- **Janus decision impact**: Public sector fee challenges

## Key Questions

1. **Why is coverage so low?** What legal and structural barriers limit collective bargaining in America?

2. **What is the first contract problem?** Why do so many new unions fail to secure initial agreements?

3. **How do strikes work?** What rights do workers have, and how have they been restricted?

4. **Public vs. private?** How do bargaining rights differ between sectors?

5. **What are the alternatives?** How do other countries achieve high bargaining coverage?

6. **What is sectoral bargaining?** Could industry-wide bargaining work in America?

## The American Bargaining Problem

### The Enterprise Bargaining Model

Unlike most developed countries, the United States relies on enterprise-level bargaining:

| Feature | U.S. Enterprise Model | Sectoral Model (Europe) |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Bargaining unit | Single workplace | Entire industry/sector |
| Who negotiates | Individual employer | Employer association |
| Coverage | Only that workplace | All workers in sector |
| Organizing cost | Must win each workplace | Win once, cover many |
| Employer incentive | Fight hard to stay non-union | Less individual resistance |

This model requires unions to win at every workplace, one by one, against intense employer resistance.

### Mandatory vs. Permissive Subjects

The NLRA divides bargaining subjects into categories:

**Mandatory Subjects** (must bargain):
- Wages and salaries
- Health insurance
- Pension and retirement
- Hours of work
- Overtime
- Safety conditions
- Seniority
- Grievance procedures

**Permissive Subjects** (may bargain):
- Retiree benefits
- Management decisions (plant closure, subcontracting)
- Corporate organization
- Investment decisions
- New products

**Illegal Subjects** (cannot bargain):
- Closed shop (requiring union membership before hiring)
- Hot cargo (refusing to handle non-union goods)
- Secondary boycotts

The division limits what unions can negotiate, particularly around fundamental business decisions that affect workers.

### The First Contract Crisis

Even after winning union elections, workers often never secure a contract:

| Outcome After Election Win | Percentage |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Contract within 1 year | 37% |
| Contract within 2 years | 63% |
| Never reach contract | 30%+ |
| Median time to first contract | 465 days |

Employers can delay bargaining indefinitely with minimal consequences, wearing down worker support.

## Public Sector Bargaining

### A Different Framework

Public sector collective bargaining operates under state law, not the NLRA:

| Aspect | Private Sector | Public Sector |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Governing law | NLRA (federal) | State laws (varies) |
| Coverage | Most private employers | Depends on state |
| Strike rights | Limited | Often prohibited |
| Scope of bargaining | Mandatory/permissive | Varies by state |
| Enforcement | NLRB | State agencies |

### State Variation

Public sector bargaining rights vary dramatically by state:

| Category | States | Bargaining Rights |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Full bargaining | CA, NY, IL, NJ, WA | Comprehensive rights |
| Limited bargaining | FL, TX (some workers) | Restricted scope |
| No bargaining | NC, VA, SC, GA | Prohibited or no framework |
| Meet and confer | Several | Consultation only |

### Janus Impact

*Janus v. AFSCME* (2018) prohibited mandatory agency fees in the public sector:

**Before Janus**:
- Non-members could be required to pay "fair share" fees
- Fees covered bargaining representation costs
- Union security maintained

**After Janus**:
- No mandatory fees for non-members
- Free rider problem emerged
- Some unions lost 10-20% of fee payers
- But most unions retained membership through organizing

## The Stakes

Weak collective bargaining means:

- **Individual vs. corporate power**: Workers negotiate alone against corporations with unlimited resources
- **Wage stagnation**: No mechanism to claim productivity gains
- **Benefit erosion**: Employers unilaterally cut benefits
- **Schedule chaos**: No protection from unpredictable hours
- **At-will vulnerability**: Termination without cause
- **Voice deprivation**: No say in workplace decisions

Strengthening collective bargaining is essential to rebuilding worker power.

## Recent Developments

### New Organizing Challenges

Despite organizing wins at Amazon, Starbucks, and elsewhere, first contract struggles continue:

| Campaign | Union Win | First Contract |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Amazon (JFK8) | April 2022 | None (as of 2024) |
| Starbucks (400+ stores) | 2022-2023 | None (as of late 2024) |
| REI (multiple stores) | 2022-2023 | Limited progress |

Employers use delay, appeal, and surface bargaining to avoid contracts.

### State-Level Innovation

Some states are expanding bargaining rights:

| State | Development |
|-------|-------------|
| California | Fast food wage board (sectoral approach) |
| Washington | Domestic worker bargaining pilot |
| New York | Farmworker collective bargaining rights |
| New Jersey | Expanded public sector bargaining |

### NLRB Activity

The Biden NLRB has strengthened bargaining requirements:

- Faster election procedures
- Cemex doctrine (bargaining orders for employer violations)
- Increased enforcement against surface bargaining
- But limited by statutory constraints

## Path Forward

Expanding collective bargaining coverage requires:

1. **First contract arbitration**: Guarantee workers get a contract after winning election
2. **Sectoral bargaining**: Negotiate by industry, not just workplace
3. **Broader mandatory subjects**: Expand what must be bargained
4. **Strike protections**: Ban permanent striker replacement
5. **Public sector floors**: Federal minimum standards
6. **Works councils**: Alternative worker voice mechanisms

## Key Takeaways

1. **Minority coverage**: Only 12% of U.S. workers are covered by collective bargaining
2. **Enterprise trap**: Workplace-by-workplace bargaining makes expansion nearly impossible
3. **First contract crisis**: 30%+ of new unions never secure a first contract
4. **Limited scope**: Many workplace decisions cannot be bargained
5. **Public sector variation**: Rights depend on state law
6. **Janus impact**: Public sector unions face free rider challenges
7. **International gap**: Most democracies have 50-90%+ coverage
8. **Reform possible**: Sectoral bargaining could transform coverage
