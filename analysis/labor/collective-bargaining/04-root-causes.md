# Collective Bargaining: Root Causes of Weakness

## Legal Framework Deficiencies

### The Enterprise Bargaining Trap

The fundamental flaw in American collective bargaining is the enterprise-level model:

**How It Works**

| Feature | American System | Sectoral Systems |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| Bargaining unit | Single workplace | Entire industry |
| Organizing required | At each location | Once per sector |
| Employer incentive | Fight hard to stay non-union | Less individual incentive |
| Worker coverage | Only winning workplaces | All workers in sector |
| Cost to organize | $1,000-$2,000 per worker | Amortized across sector |

**Why This Fails**

The enterprise model means:

1. **Infinite organizing requirement**: Must win at every workplace, forever
2. **Employer resistance maximized**: Each employer faces full costs of unionization
3. **Competition on wages**: Non-union employers undercut union employers
4. **Constant vulnerability**: Employers can move, close, subcontract

### Inadequate Duty to Bargain

The legal requirement to bargain "in good faith" has been rendered nearly meaningless:

**Surface Bargaining**

Employers can satisfy legal requirements while never intending to reach agreement:

| Tactic | Description | Legal Status |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Attend meetings | Show up at negotiating sessions | Satisfies duty |
| Make proposals | Offer terms you know are unacceptable | Satisfies duty |
| Take hard positions | Refuse to move on key issues | Legal "hard bargaining" |
| Delay indefinitely | Stretch process over years | Often not found as violation |
| Wait for decertification | Worker support erodes | Common strategy |

**The First Contract Problem**

| Outcome After Election Win | Percentage |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Contract within 1 year | 37% |
| Contract within 2 years | 56% |
| Never reach contract | 30-37% |

No legal mechanism forces employers to actually agree to a contract.

### Limited Scope of Bargaining

**Mandatory vs. Permissive Subjects**

| Category | Subject | Can Bargain? | Must Bargain? |
|----------|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Mandatory | Wages | Yes | Yes |
| Mandatory | Benefits | Yes | Yes |
| Mandatory | Hours | Yes | Yes |
| Permissive | Plant closure | Yes | No |
| Permissive | Subcontracting decision | Yes | No |
| Permissive | Relocation | Yes | No |
| Permissive | Technology adoption | Yes | No |

**Key Limitations**

- *First National Maintenance* (1981): Employers need not bargain over economic decisions to close
- *Fibreboard* (1964): Subcontracting may not be mandatory subject
- General pattern: Fundamental business decisions affecting workers are often permissive

**The Effects Bargaining Doctrine**

Even when decisions are permissive, employers must bargain over effects. But:

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Timing | Decision already made |
| Leverage | Workers have none after fact |
| Scope | Only effects, not decision itself |
| Outcomes | Usually severance, not reversal |

### Strike Right Limitations

**The Permanent Replacement Doctrine**

Since *NLRB v. Mackay Radio* (1938), employers can permanently replace economic strikers:

| Type of Strike | Permanent Replacement | Protection |
|----------------|----------------------|------------|
| Economic strike | Allowed | Limited |
| ULP strike | Not allowed | Full protection |
| Sympathy strike | May be allowed | Uncertain |

**PATCO Effect**

After Reagan fired the PATCO strikers (1981), private employers aggressively used permanent replacement:

| Period | Annual Major Strikes | Replacement Threats |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Pre-1981 | 250-300 | Rare |
| Post-1981 | 20-50 | Common |

**Strike Decline**

| Year | Major Stoppages | Workers Involved |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| 1979 | 235 | 1.0 million |
| 1989 | 51 | 452,000 |
| 1999 | 17 | 73,000 |
| 2019 | 25 | 425,000 |

Without effective strike rights, bargaining power evaporates.

### Secondary Activity Prohibitions

Taft-Hartley banned critical solidarity tactics:

| Tactic | Description | Legal Status |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Secondary boycott | Pressure employer's suppliers/customers | Illegal |
| Hot cargo | Refuse to handle non-union goods | Illegal |
| Sympathy strike | Strike in support of other workers | Restricted |
| Jurisdictional strike | Strike over work assignment | Illegal |

**Impact**

Without secondary pressure, unions cannot:

- Apply economic pressure through supply chains
- Build industry-wide solidarity
- Counter corporate consolidation with worker consolidation

## Public Sector Complications

### State-by-State Fragmentation

**Variation in Bargaining Rights**

| State Category | Number | Rights |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| Full bargaining | 26 | Comprehensive rights, some strike rights |
| Limited bargaining | 12 | Restricted scope, no strikes |
| Meet and confer | 5 | Consultation only |
| No framework | 7 | No legal protection |

**Consequences of Fragmentation**

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Inconsistent coverage | Rights depend on geography |
| Race to bottom | States compete on weak labor law |
| Organizing challenges | Different strategies needed |
| Political vulnerability | State legislatures can eliminate rights |

### Essential Services Restrictions

**Strike Prohibitions**

| Category | Strike Right |
|----------|-------------|
| Federal employees | Prohibited |
| Most state employees | Prohibited or limited |
| Police and fire | Usually prohibited |
| Teachers | Varies (often prohibited) |
| Healthcare | May be limited |

**Alternatives to Strikes**

| Alternative | Description | Effectiveness |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Interest arbitration | Third party decides | Mixed |
| Fact-finding | Non-binding recommendations | Weak |
| Mediation | Facilitated negotiation | Limited |
| Work-to-rule | Follow all rules exactly | Limited |

### Janus and the Free Rider Problem

**The Free Rider Economics**

| With Agency Fees | Without Agency Fees |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Non-members pay fair share | Non-members pay nothing |
| Union has resources | Union loses revenue |
| Organizing capacity maintained | Organizing capacity reduced |
| Less incentive to opt out | Strong incentive to opt out |

**Structural Problem**

Unions must represent all workers in bargaining unit but cannot require payment from non-members. This creates:

- Resource drain (representing non-payers)
- Incentive distortion (why pay for free service?)
- Organizing burden (must constantly recruit)

## Economic and Structural Causes

### Deindustrialization

**Manufacturing Employment Decline**

| Year | Manufacturing Workers | Share of Employment |
|------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 1950 | 15.2 million | 30% |
| 1980 | 18.7 million | 19% |
| 2000 | 17.3 million | 13% |
| 2020 | 12.2 million | 8% |

**Why Manufacturing Mattered**

| Factor | Advantage for Bargaining |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Large workplaces | Economies of organizing |
| Concentrated industry | Pattern bargaining possible |
| Production bottlenecks | Strike leverage |
| Stable employment | Long-term worker commitment |

### Service Sector Characteristics

**Why Services Are Harder to Organize**

| Factor | Manufacturing | Services |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Workplace size | Large (hundreds) | Small (dozens) |
| Turnover | Low | High |
| Employment type | Full-time | Often part-time |
| Geographic concentration | Regional | Dispersed |
| Customer contact | Indirect | Direct |

**Service Sector Growth**

| Sector | 1970 Employment | 2020 Employment | Growth |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Healthcare | 4.2 million | 16.5 million | +293% |
| Retail | 11.0 million | 14.7 million | +34% |
| Food service | 3.1 million | 11.2 million | +261% |
| Professional services | 6.5 million | 21.5 million | +231% |

### Fissured Workplace

**Fragmentation of Employment**

| Practice | Effect on Bargaining |
|----------|---------------------|
| Subcontracting | Workers employed by contractor, not lead company |
| Franchising | Brand controls everything, franchisee employs |
| Temp agencies | Employer ambiguity |
| Independent contractors | No NLRA coverage |
| Gig platforms | Misclassified as contractors |

**Joint Employer Problem**

| Entity | Control | Employment Relationship |
|--------|---------|------------------------|
| Brand/franchisor | Sets terms, standards, prices | No (claims not employer) |
| Franchisee | Limited discretion | Yes |
| Lead contractor | Controls work | No (claims not employer) |
| Subcontractor | Provides workers | Yes |

Workers can't effectively bargain with the entity that actually controls their working conditions.

## Employer Opposition

### The Union Avoidance Industry

**Industry Scale**

| Metric | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| Annual employer spending | $340+ million (disclosed) |
| Consulting firms | 400+ |
| Specialized law firms | 1,000+ |
| Campaigns using consultants | 75% |

**Services Offered**

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Supervisor training | Anti-union messaging |
| Campaign management | Full-service union avoidance |
| Captive audience content | Scripts, videos |
| Legal strategy | Delay, challenge, appeal |
| Surveillance | Identify union supporters |

### Captive Audience Meetings

**The Asymmetry**

| Party | Access |
|-------|--------|
| Employer | Mandatory meetings during work hours |
| Union | Limited non-work time access |
| Employer | Unlimited communication |
| Union | Restricted locations and times |

**Effects**

| Metric | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Campaigns with captive meetings | 89% |
| Average meetings per campaign | 10+ |
| Effect on union win rate | -10 to -15 percentage points |

### Illegal But Rational

**Violation Cost-Benefit**

| Violation | Penalty | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Fire union supporter | Back pay (minus earnings) | Chilling effect, win campaign |
| Threaten closure | Cease and desist | Workers scared, union loses |
| Promise benefits | Cease and desist | Workers swayed, union loses |
| Surface bargain | Bargaining order | Years of delay, no contract |

**Prevalence of Violations**

| Tactic | Percentage of Campaigns |
|--------|------------------------|
| Threats to close | 57% |
| Threats to cut wages | 47% |
| Firing supporters | 34% |
| Surveillance | 31% |

## Political Causes

### Legislative Failure

**Failed Reform Attempts**

| Year | Proposal | Outcome |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1978 | Labor law reform | Filibustered |
| 1992 | Striker replacement ban | Filibustered |
| 1994 | TEAM Act (pro-employer) | Vetoed |
| 2009 | Employee Free Choice Act | Never reached vote |
| 2021 | PRO Act | Passed House, blocked in Senate |

The filibuster has blocked every major labor law reform for 50 years.

### Money Imbalance

**Political Spending Comparison (2020 cycle)**

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Business spending | $3.4 billion |
| Labor spending | $221 million |
| Ratio | 15:1 |

Employers have vastly more political resources than workers.

### Ideological Shift

**Both Parties Moved Right on Labor**

| Party | 1960s Position | Current Position |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| Democrats | Strong labor support | Mixed |
| Republicans | Moderate skepticism | Hostile |

The New Deal coalition that created labor rights has fragmented.

## Self-Reinforcing Cycle

### The Decline Spiral

```text
Weak bargaining law
       |
       v
Difficult to organize
       |
       v
Lower union density
       |
       v
Less political power
       |
       v
Can't reform law
       |
       v
[Repeat]
```

### Declining Resources

| Year | Union Density | Political Power | Reform Capacity |
|------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1955 | 35% | Strong | Could pass legislation |
| 1985 | 18% | Weakening | Defensive only |
| 2023 | 10% | Weak | Cannot pass major reforms |

As density declines, so does the power to fix the system.

## Why This Matters

### The Coverage Gap Explained

The causes above explain why:

- Only 12% of workers are covered by bargaining
- 30% of new unions never get contracts
- Strike activity has collapsed
- Employer violations are routine
- Reform is perpetually blocked

### The Stakes

Without collective bargaining, workers:

- Negotiate alone against corporate power
- Have no voice in workplace decisions
- Cannot claim their share of productivity gains
- Face unilateral employer decisions on pay, benefits, conditions

The decline of collective bargaining is central to rising inequality and wage stagnation.
