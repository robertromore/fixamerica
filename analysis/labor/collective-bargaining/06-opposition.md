# Collective Bargaining: Opposition Analysis

## Primary Opponents

### Large Corporations

**Profile**

Major employers invest heavily in avoiding and weakening collective bargaining:

| Company | Employees | Bargaining Coverage | Opposition Investment |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Walmart | 2.1 million | <1% | Extensive anti-union programs |
| Amazon | 1.5 million | <0.5% | $14.2 million (2022) |
| Starbucks | 450,000 | <5% | Hundreds of ULP charges |
| McDonald's (system) | 2+ million | <1% | Franchisee training |
| Tesla | 130,000 | 0% | Aggressive opposition |

**Why They Oppose**

| Reason | Financial Impact |
|--------|-----------------|
| Higher wages | Union premium 10-20% of payroll |
| Better benefits | Additional 15-30% cost |
| Work rules | Reduced flexibility |
| Just cause | Cannot fire at will |

| Precedent | One win spreads |

**Case Study: Starbucks Bargaining Resistance**

| Year | Stores Unionized | First Contracts | ULP Charges |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 2022 | 200+ | 0 | 200+ |
| 2023 | 400+ | 0 | 400+ |
| 2024 | 500+ | 0 (limited progress) | 500+ |

Despite winning hundreds of elections, Starbucks Workers United had achieved no first contracts by late 2024, illustrating systematic bargaining resistance.

## Their Tactics

### First Contract Avoidance

**Delay Strategies**

| Tactic | Description | Effect |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Challenge election | File objections to results | Months/years delay |
| Litigate unit scope | Appeal bargaining unit determination | Further delay |
| Surface bargaining | Meet but don't intend to agree | Indefinite delay |
| Information stonewalling | Refuse or delay information requests | Slow negotiations |
| Unilateral changes | Make changes without bargaining | Undermine union |

**Surface Bargaining Techniques**

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Extreme proposals | Demands no union could accept |
| Slow response | Weeks between sessions |
| Limited authority | Negotiator can't make decisions |
| Continuous regression | Withdraw previous agreements |
| Package only | Refuse tentative agreements |

**Legal Cover**

Courts have held that employers can:

- Take hard bargaining positions
- Refuse to agree to anything
- Insist on positions to impasse
- Change terms unilaterally after impasse

The line between legal "hard bargaining" and illegal "surface bargaining" is extremely difficult to prove.

### Strike Breaking

**Permanent Replacement**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Legal basis | *Mackay Radio* (1938) |
| Employer right | Hire permanent replacements |
| Striker status | Job may be given to replacement |
| Return rights | Only when vacancy arises |

**Modern Strike Management**

| Service | Provider |
|---------|----------|
| Replacement workers | Staffing agencies, specialized firms |
| Security | Private security firms |
| Legal support | Management law firms |
| Public relations | Crisis management firms |
| Facility operation | Strike management consultants |

**Effect on Bargaining**

| Period | Strikes per Year | Replacement Threat |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Pre-1981 | 250-300 | Rare |
| Post-1981 | 20-50 | Standard |

The threat of permanent replacement means employers can force impasse and replace strikers, eliminating union leverage.

### Scope Limitation

**Pushing Permissive Subjects**

Employers argue that more subjects should be permissive (not required to bargain):

| Subject | Employer Argument | Effect |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Subcontracting | Business decision | Workers can't bargain |
| Technology | Management prerogative | Workers excluded |
| Relocation | Economic decision | Fait accompli |
| Layoff decisions | Business judgment | Effects only |

**Management Rights Clause Expansion**

| Evolution | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Narrow rights | Clear list of reserved decisions |
| Broad rights | General management authority |
| Zipper clauses | Bar mid-contract bargaining |
| Past practice limits | Restrict union claims |

### Decertification Campaigns

**When Used**

| Timing | Strategy |
|--------|----------|
| After first contract failure | Workers frustrated, no results |
| During economic downturn | Workers fear job loss |
| After leadership change | New management aggressive |
| After concession bargaining | Workers blame union |

**Employer Support**

While employers cannot directly petition for decertification, they can:

- Provide information to workers
- Allow decertification activity on premises
- Highlight union failures
- Create conditions fostering dissatisfaction

### Public Sector Attacks

**Janus Strategy**

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Legal challenge | Fund litigation to Supreme Court |
| Decision | Win 5-4 ruling against fees |
| Implementation | Organize workers to opt out |
| Membership drives | Encourage dropping membership |

**Right to Work for Public Sector**

| State Type | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Private right-to-work | 27 states |
| Janus effect | All public sector (national) |
| Dual impact | 27 states have both |

### Messaging Against Bargaining

**Anti-Bargaining Arguments**

| Argument | Employer Frame | Reality |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| Flexibility | Bargaining creates rigidity | Workers need predictability |
| Competitiveness | Unions make business uncompetitive | Union countries are competitive |
| Third parties | Outside interference | Workers choose representation |
| Adversarial | Creates conflict | Employer creates conflict |
| Outdated | Modern workplaces don't need unions | Workers still need voice |

**Framing First Contracts**

| Message | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| "Negotiations take time" | Normalize delay |
| "Starting from zero" | Scare workers |
| "No guarantees" | Create uncertainty |
| "Union can't deliver" | Undermine confidence |

## Their Weaknesses

### Public Opinion Shift

**Support for Collective Bargaining**

| Year | Favor Unions | Want Union at Workplace |
|------|-------------|------------------------|
| 2009 | 48% | 40% |
| 2017 | 61% | 45% |
| 2022 | 71% | 48% |

Public support for unions is at highest levels since 1960s.

### First Contract Failures Expose System

When workers win elections but never get contracts, it:

- Exposes system as rigged
- Generates public sympathy
- Creates pressure for reform
- Motivates other workers

**High-Profile Examples**

| Campaign | Election | Contract | Public Impact |
|----------|----------|----------|---------------|
| Starbucks | 500+ wins | 0 | Major media coverage |
| Amazon | 1 win (JFK8) | 0 | National attention |
| REI | Multiple wins | Limited | Consumer awareness |

### Legal Vulnerability

**ULP Exposure**

| Company | ULP Charges (2022-2024) |
|---------|------------------------|
| Starbucks | 500+ |
| Amazon | 100+ |
| Apple | 20+ |

High-profile violations create:

- Legal costs
- Reputational damage
- Regulatory scrutiny
- Political pressure

### Brand Sensitivity

Companies with consumer-facing brands are vulnerable:

| Company | Brand Image | Union Campaign Impact |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| Starbucks | Progressive values | Hypocrisy exposure |
| Apple | Innovation, cool | Worker treatment contrast |
| REI | Co-op, outdoor ethics | Values contradiction |

### Internal Contradictions

| Claim | Contradiction |
|-------|---------------|
| "We value employees" | Fight employees who want voice |
| "We're family" | Fire family members who organize |
| "Open door policy" | But not collective voice |
| "We pay well" | Then why fear transparency of contract? |

### Economic Evidence

**Research Findings**

| Claim | Evidence Against |
|-------|------------------|
| Unions kill jobs | Job growth similar in union/non-union |
| Unions hurt economy | IMF/OECD find no negative growth effect |
| Unions cause inflation | Minor wage-price effects |
| Companies can't afford | Record corporate profits |

## Counter-Strategies

| Adversarial | Seeking fairness |
| Rigid | Predictable, fair |
| Uncompetitive | Investing in workers |
