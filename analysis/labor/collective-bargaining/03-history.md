# Collective Bargaining: History

## Before Legal Protection (Pre-1935)

### Early Collective Action

Before formal collective bargaining rights, workers organized informally:

**Colonial and Early Republic Period**

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1792 | Philadelphia shoemakers form first craft union |
| 1806 | *Commonwealth v. Pullis* - striking shoemakers convicted of criminal conspiracy |
| 1842 | *Commonwealth v. Hunt* - Massachusetts court rules unions are legal |
| 1860s | National unions form in skilled trades |

**The Criminal Conspiracy Doctrine**

For decades, courts treated collective action as criminal conspiracy. Employers could:

- Have strikers arrested
- Obtain court injunctions against organizing
- Sue unions for damages from boycotts

### The Gilded Age (1870-1900)

**Pattern of Violence**

| Event | Year | Outcome |
|-------|------|---------|
| Great Railroad Strike | 1877 | Federal troops deployed; 100+ killed |
| Haymarket | 1886 | Labor leaders executed; movement set back |
| Homestead | 1892 | Pinkertons kill workers; union crushed |
| Pullman | 1894 | Federal injunction; Debs jailed |

Without legal protection, collective bargaining depended on raw economic power, and employers used violence and government force to resist.

### Progressive Era Reforms (1900-1930)

**Limited Recognition**

Some industries achieved informal recognition:

| Industry | Status | Coverage |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Railroads | Voluntary recognition | Major carriers |
| Coal mining | Regional agreements | Unionized regions |
| Construction | Craft union strength | Some cities |
| Printing | Closed shops | Major cities |

**Legal Developments**

| Law/Case | Year | Effect |
|----------|------|--------|
| Clayton Act | 1914 | Attempted to protect union activity from antitrust |
| Courts narrowed Clayton | 1920s | Injunctions continued |
| Railway Labor Act | 1926 | First federal bargaining mandate (railroads only) |

## The New Deal Revolution (1935-1947)

### The Wagner Act (1935)

The National Labor Relations Act fundamentally transformed collective bargaining:

**Key Provisions**

| Section | Provision | Effect |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Section 7 | Right to organize and bargain collectively | Workers protected |
| Section 8(a) | Employer unfair labor practices | Violations defined |
| Section 9 | Majority rule representation | Democratic selection |
| NLRB created | Independent agency | Enforcement mechanism |

**Employer Unfair Labor Practices Defined**

| Violation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 8(a)(1) | Interfering with organizing rights |
| 8(a)(2) | Dominating or funding company unions |
| 8(a)(3) | Discriminating against union supporters |
| 8(a)(4) | Retaliating for filing NLRB charges |
| 8(a)(5) | Refusing to bargain in good faith |

**The Duty to Bargain**

For the first time, employers had a legal obligation to:

- Recognize unions chosen by majority vote
- Meet at reasonable times and places
- Bargain in good faith over wages, hours, and conditions
- Provide relevant information to unions

### Explosive Growth (1935-1945)

**Union Membership and Coverage**

| Year | Union Members | Density | Coverage |
|------|---------------|---------|----------|
| 1935 | 3.6 million | 13.2% | ~14% |
| 1940 | 8.7 million | 26.9% | ~28% |
| 1945 | 14.3 million | 35.5% | ~36% |

**Major Breakthroughs**

| Industry | Year | Union | Impact |
|----------|------|-------|--------|
| Auto (GM) | 1937 | UAW | Sit-down strike; recognition |
| Steel (US Steel) | 1937 | USWA | Voluntary recognition |
| Rubber | 1936-37 | URW | Industry-wide contracts |
| Electrical | 1937-40 | UE/IUE | Major manufacturers |

### The War Years

World War II accelerated bargaining growth:

| Development | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| War Labor Board | Mediated disputes, maintained production |
| Maintenance of membership | Union security strengthened |
| Cost of living adjustments | Built into contracts |
| No-strike pledge | Unions gained legitimacy |
| Employer cooperation | Needed labor peace for war |

## The Taft-Hartley Era (1947-1960s)

### The 1947 Amendments

The Taft-Hartley Act fundamentally restricted collective bargaining:

**New Union Unfair Labor Practices**

| Violation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 8(b)(1) | Restraining employees in exercise of rights |
| 8(b)(2) | Causing discrimination by employer |
| 8(b)(3) | Refusing to bargain in good faith |
| 8(b)(4) | Secondary boycotts |
| 8(b)(5) | Excessive initiation fees |
| 8(b)(6) | Featherbedding |
| 8(b)(7) | Certain picketing restrictions |

**Restrictions on Bargaining Power**

| Provision | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Section 14(b) | Authorized state right-to-work laws |
| Secondary boycott ban | Unions couldn't pressure supply chains |
| Hot cargo ban | Couldn't refuse non-union goods |
| Closed shop ban | Couldn't require pre-hire membership |
| Employer "free speech" | Legitimized anti-union campaigns |
| 80-day injunctions | President could halt "emergency" strikes |

### Impact on Bargaining

**Immediate Effects**

- Right-to-work laws spread through South
- Anti-union campaigns became normal
- Communist affidavit requirement purged radicals
- Secondary pressure eliminated

**Long-Term Consequences**

| Outcome | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Southern organizing failed | Right-to-work, employer resistance |
| Industrial union leverage reduced | Couldn't apply supply chain pressure |
| Employer resistance legitimized | "Free speech" covered anti-union campaigns |
| Pattern: decline began | Seeds of long-term erosion planted |

### Peak and Plateau (1954-1965)

**The High Point**

| Metric | 1954 | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Union density | 35% | Peak membership rate |
| Bargaining coverage | ~36% | Highest coverage |
| Strike power | Strong | Workers could and did strike |
| Pattern bargaining | Widespread | Industry-wide standards |

**The "Treaty of Detroit" Model**

The 1950 UAW-GM contract established a template:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Multi-year contract | 5 years initially |
| COLA clause | Wages tied to inflation |
| Annual improvement factor | 3% annual raises |
| Health insurance | Employer-provided coverage |
| Pension | Defined benefit plan |
| SUB pay | Supplemental unemployment benefits |

This model spread to other industries, creating the American middle class.

## Public Sector Emergence (1960s-1970s)

### Executive Order 10988 (1962)

President Kennedy's order began public sector bargaining:

**Federal Workers**

| Feature | Provision |
|---------|-----------|
| Right to organize | Recognized |
| Collective bargaining | Limited scope |
| Union security | Prohibited |
| Strikes | Prohibited |
| Arbitration | Advisory only |

### State-Level Expansion

| State | Year | Coverage |
|-------|------|----------|
| Wisconsin | 1959 | Public employees |
| New York | 1967 | Taylor Law |
| California | 1968 | Meyers-Milias-Brown |
| Pennsylvania | 1970 | Public Employee Relations Act |
| Illinois | 1984 | Public Labor Relations Act |

**Public Sector Union Growth**

| Union | 1960 Members | 1980 Members |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| AFSCME | 100,000 | 1 million |
| AFT | 60,000 | 500,000 |
| NEA | Began bargaining | 1.7 million |

### Distinctive Public Sector Features

| Feature | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Strike restrictions | Essential services |
| Scope limitations | Political decisions excluded |
| Interest arbitration | Alternative to strikes |
| Meet and confer | Some states only |

## The Era of Decline (1970s-Present)

### Economic Restructuring

**Deindustrialization**

| Industry | 1970 Employment | 2000 Employment | Decline |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| Steel | 500,000 | 150,000 | -70% |
| Auto | 800,000 | 400,000 | -50% |
| Rubber | 150,000 | 50,000 | -67% |
| Textiles | 1 million | 300,000 | -70% |

**Geographic Shift**

- Production moved to non-union South
- Globalization shifted manufacturing overseas
- Service sector (hard to organize) grew
- Bargaining power eroded with jobs

### Legal Erosion

**Key Court Decisions**

| Case | Year | Holding | Impact |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| *NLRB v. Mackay Radio* | 1938 | Permanent striker replacement allowed | Strike deterrent |
| *First National Maintenance* | 1981 | Plant closure not mandatory subject | Limited scope |
| *Lechmere* | 1992 | Limited organizer access | Harder to organize |
| *Epic Systems* | 2018 | Class action waivers upheld | Workers isolated |
| *Janus* | 2018 | No mandatory public sector fees | Free rider problem |

### The PATCO Watershed (1981)

**Timeline**

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| August 3, 1981 | 13,000 air traffic controllers strike |
| August 5, 1981 | Reagan fires all strikers |
| October 1981 | PATCO decertified |

**Significance**

The PATCO firing signaled that permanent replacement was acceptable:

| Period | Average Annual Major Strikes |
|--------|----------------------------|
| 1947-1980 | 289 |
| 1981-1990 | 46 |
| 1991-2000 | 34 |
| 2001-2010 | 20 |
| 2011-2020 | 14 |

Strike activity collapsed, eliminating labor's primary economic weapon.

### Concession Bargaining (1980s)

The era of growing wages and benefits reversed:

**Pattern of Concessions**

| Industry | Concession Type |
|----------|-----------------|
| Auto (1982) | Wage freeze, benefit cuts |
| Steel | Massive wage cuts, job losses |
| Airlines | Two-tier wages, pension cuts |
| Meatpacking | Wage cuts of 25-40% |
| Trucking | Deregulation destroyed pattern |

### Janus v. AFSCME (2018)

**The Decision**

The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that public sector workers cannot be required to pay agency fees, overturning *Abood v. Detroit Board of Education* (1977).

**Reasoning**

| Argument | Court's Position |
|----------|-----------------|
| Compelled speech | Fees force support for union speech |
| Public sector unique | Government employer makes union political |
| Worker freedom | Must opt in, not out |

**Impact**

| Metric | Pre-Janus | Post-Janus |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Agency fee requirement | 22 states | 0 states |
| Free riders | ~0 | Millions potential |
| Union membership (initial) | Baseline | Some decline |
| Membership (stabilized) | Baseline | Mostly maintained |

Most unions retained members through internal organizing, but the financial and organizing burden increased.

## Recent Developments (2020s)

### The Organizing Wave

Despite weak bargaining law, new organizing has surged:

| Campaign | Outcome | Bargaining Status |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Amazon (JFK8) | Won April 2022 | No contract (as of 2024) |
| Starbucks (400+ stores) | Most won | No contracts |
| REI (multiple) | Won | Limited progress |
| Apple (several stores) | Won | Negotiations ongoing |

### Strike Resurgence

2023 saw the most strike activity in decades:

| Strike | Workers | Outcome |
|--------|---------|---------|
| WGA strike | 11,500 | Major gains after 148 days |
| SAG-AFTRA | 160,000 | Major gains after 118 days |
| UAW (Big Three) | 46,000 | Historic gains |
| UPS (threatened) | 340,000 | Major contract without strike |

### NLRB Developments

**Biden Board Actions**

| Development | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Faster elections | Reduced employer delay |
| Cemex doctrine | Bargaining orders for violations |
| Joint employer rule | Broader accountability |
| Stronger remedies | Increased enforcement |

| 2022 | Amazon (JFK8) union victory |
| 2023 | Historic strike activity |

## Lessons from History

### What Enabled Strong Bargaining

1. **Legal framework**: Wagner Act created enforceable duty to bargain
2. **Economic leverage**: Strikes were effective when not deterred
3. **Industrial concentration**: Large workplaces easier to organize
4. **Pattern bargaining**: Extended gains across industries
5. **Political support**: New Deal coalition backed labor

### What Caused Decline

1. **Legal restrictions**: Taft-Hartley limited tools and tactics
2. **Permanent replacement**: Eliminated strike leverage
3. **Scope limitations**: Key decisions excluded from bargaining
4. **Deindustrialization**: Union jobs disappeared
5. **Political abandonment**: Both parties moved right on labor
6. **Employer sophistication**: Union avoidance became an industry

### The Unfinished Story

Collective bargaining law remains essentially unchanged since 1947. The legal framework that once enabled mass organization now facilitates mass decline. Reform efforts have repeatedly failed against Senate filibuster and employer opposition.
