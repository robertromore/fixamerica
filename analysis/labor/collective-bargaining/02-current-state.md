**Permanent Replacement Impact**

Since the *Mackay Radio* (1938) and PATCO (1981) precedents, permanent striker replacement has severely limited strike effectiveness:

## Pattern Bargaining

### How Pattern Bargaining Works

In some industries, unions negotiate with one employer first, establishing a "pattern" that other employers follow:

**Industries with Pattern Bargaining**

| Industry | Lead Employer/Union | Pattern Followers |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Auto | Big Three/UAW | Parts suppliers, others |
| Steel | US Steel, others/USW | Industry-wide |
| Healthcare | Major hospital systems | Regional patterns |
| Trucking | National Master Freight/IBT | Major carriers |

### Pattern Bargaining Decline

| Era | Pattern Strength |
|-----|-----------------|
| 1950s-1970s | Strong patterns across industries |
| 1980s-1990s | Patterns weakened, concession bargaining |
| 2000s-present | Patterns limited to few industries |

Pattern bargaining provided de facto sectoral coverage without formal sectoral agreements.
