# Collective Bargaining: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Reforming collective bargaining law requires addressing decades of erosion through amendments, court decisions, and weak enforcement. This document provides draft legislation addressing the key barriers to effective collective bargaining, along with analysis of potential loopholes and implementation challenges.

## Constitutional Considerations

### Commerce Clause Authority

Congress has clear authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate labor relations affecting interstate commerce. The NLRA has been upheld since *NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel* (1937).

### First Amendment Issues

**Current Doctrine**

| Case | Holding | Relevance to Bargaining |
|------|---------|------------------------|
| *NLRB v. Gissel Packing* (1969) | Employer speech protected unless threatening | Legitimizes anti-bargaining campaigns |
| *Janus v. AFSCME* (2018) | Public sector fees are compelled speech | Free rider problem |

**Reform Implications**

Reforms affecting employer speech (captive audience bans) face First Amendment challenges but can be structured as protecting worker rights, not restricting speech.

### Tenth Amendment

Public sector bargaining regulation by Congress raises federalism concerns, but federal floors that allow states to exceed minimum standards have been upheld.

## Federal Legislation

### First Contract Arbitration Act

**Purpose**: Guarantee workers who vote for union representation can secure a first contract.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "First Contract Arbitration Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that:
    (1) Approximately 30 percent of workers who vote for union
        representation never obtain a first collective bargaining
        agreement;
    (2) Employers can delay first contract bargaining indefinitely
        under current law;
    (3) Median time to first contract is 465 days;
    (4) This failure undermines workers' statutory right to
        bargain collectively.

(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to ensure that workers
    who exercise their right to organize can achieve a collective
    bargaining agreement within a reasonable time.

SEC. 3. FIRST CONTRACT PROCEDURES.

(a) DUTY TO BARGAIN.—Upon certification or recognition of a
    labor organization, the employer and labor organization shall
    meet and bargain in good faith with the intent to reach a
    collective bargaining agreement.

(b) MEDIATION.—
    (1) If the parties have not reached an agreement within 90
        days of certification, either party may request that the
        Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service assign a
        mediator.
    (2) The FMCS shall assign a mediator within 7 days of request.
    (3) Mediation shall continue for 30 days or until the parties
        reach agreement.

(c) INTEREST ARBITRATION.—
    (1) If mediation does not result in a collective bargaining
        agreement, either party may request binding arbitration.
    (2) Within 14 days, the parties shall jointly select an
        arbitrator. If they cannot agree, the FMCS shall appoint
        an arbitrator from its roster.
    (3) The arbitrator shall conduct proceedings and render a
        decision within 60 days.
    (4) The arbitrator's decision shall establish the terms of a
        collective bargaining agreement with a duration of not
        less than two years.
    (5) In rendering the decision, the arbitrator shall consider:
        (A) The terms of comparable collective bargaining
            agreements;
        (B) The financial capacity of the employer;
        (C) The interests of the employees;
        (D) The public interest.

(d) EFFECT OF ARBITRATION AWARD.—
    (1) The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the
        parties.
    (2) The award may be enforced in federal district court.
    (3) The award shall have the same effect as a voluntary
        collective bargaining agreement.

SEC. 4. PRELIMINARY RELIEF.

(a) The Board may seek appropriate temporary restraining orders
    or preliminary injunctions in federal district court upon
    filing of a charge alleging that the employer has failed to
    bargain in good faith during first contract negotiations.

SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 90 days after enactment.

        (A) to permanently replace an employee who exercises the
            right to strike under this Act;
        (B) to offer permanent employment to any replacement
            worker during a labor dispute;
        (C) to discriminate against a former striker in hiring
            after a strike ends.

(b) TEMPORARY REPLACEMENT.—Nothing in this section shall
    prohibit an employer from using temporary replacement
    workers during a strike.

(c) REINSTATEMENT RIGHTS.—
    (1) All strikers shall be entitled to immediate reinstatement
        upon unconditional offer to return to work;
    (2) Strikers shall retain their seniority and all other
        employment rights;

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### First Contract Arbitration Loopholes

**Potential Loopholes**

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Arbitrator selection delay | Parties cannot agree, process stalls | Medium |
| Comparable contract dispute | Disagreement over comparables | Medium |
| Financial information manipulation | Employers hide capacity | High |
| Appeal and litigation | Challenge arbitration award | High |
| Bad faith participation | Undermine arbitration process | Medium |
| Contract duration gaming | Short contracts, repeat process | Low |

**Shortcomings**

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Arbitration quality | Inconsistent outcomes | Arbitrator selection |
| Employer gaming | Delay within process | Incentive structure |
| Worker expectations | May not get all demands | Arbitration nature |
| Subsequent contracts | Only covers first contract | Scope limitation |
| FMCS capacity | May be overwhelmed | Funding constraints |

**Rectification Procedures**

1. **Arbitrator selection delay**: If parties cannot agree within 14 days, NLRB/FMCS automatically assigns from approved roster; no extensions allowed

2. **Comparable contracts**: Establish pre-approved list of comparable contracts by industry and region; arbitrator must select from list unless compelling reason

3. **Financial information**: Require employers to provide certified financial statements; impose adverse inference for non-disclosure; allow independent auditor review

4. **Litigation limits**: Award enforceable immediately; judicial review limited to procedural violations; no de novo review of substance

5. **Bad faith participation**: Define objective standards; civil penalties for bad faith; extend arbitration timeline if employer delays

6. **Subsequent contracts**: Apply expedited dispute resolution to second and third contracts; reduce timelines for experienced bargaining relationships

### Sectoral Bargaining Loopholes

**Potential Loopholes**

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Industry definition gaming | Employers claim not in covered sector | High |
| Franchise restructuring | Restructure to avoid coverage | High |
| Small employer exemption | Thresholds allow evasion | Medium |
| Multi-state operations | Apply only to in-state | Medium |
| Representative disputes | Who speaks for workers | Medium |

| Enforcement resources | State agencies underfunded | Budget constraints |
| Political reversibility | New administration can repeal | Electoral politics |
| Scope limitations | May not cover all issues | Legal constraints |
| Worker awareness | Don't know rights exist | Communication |

**Rectification Procedures**

1. **Industry definition**: Use NAICS codes as baseline; burden on employer to prove exemption; agency authority to make binding determinations

2. **Franchise restructuring**: Apply to franchisor and franchisee jointly; look to economic reality; anti-circumvention provisions

3. **Small employer threshold**: Low threshold (10 employees); phase-in period for compliance; sector-wide minimum with exemption process

4. **Multi-state operations**: Apply to all work performed in state; reciprocity agreements with other states; anti-retaliation for out-of-state workers

5. **Representative selection**: Clear process for worker organization selection; periodic re-determination; multiple organization participation where appropriate

6. **Employer association**: Create default association through chamber or industry group; mandatory participation above threshold; government can facilitate

### Striker Protection Loopholes

**Potential Loopholes**

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Temporary to permanent conversion | "Temporary" becomes indefinite | High |
| Subcontracting strike work | Transfer work to avoid hiring | High |
| Plant closure | Close rather than continue with union | High |
| Striker misconduct claims | Manufacture reasons to deny reinstatement | High |

**Shortcomings**

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Economic strike definition | Some strikes may not qualify | Legal categories |

2. **Subcontracting**: Prohibit subcontracting struck work; treat as direct hiring; joint employer liability

3. **Plant closure**: Require advance notice; severance obligations; limit closure during active bargaining

4. **Misconduct claims**: Clear and convincing evidence standard; neutral arbitration; back pay pending determination

5. **Bankruptcy**: Treat collective bargaining obligations as priority claims; require court approval for rejection; protect striker rights in bankruptcy

### Cross-Cutting Implementation Issues

**Systemic Vulnerabilities**

| Vulnerability | Affects | Mitigation |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| Court challenges | All reforms | Strong legislative findings; clear constitutional basis |
| NLRB composition changes | Federal reforms | Codify rules in statute |
| Appropriations cuts | Enforcement | Mandatory funding; user fees |
| State preemption | State reforms | Build before federal action |

**Monitoring Requirements**

| Metric | Frequency | Responsible Entity |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| First contract success rate | Annual | FMCS, BLS |
| Time to first contract | Quarterly | NLRB |
| Sectoral coverage | Annual | State agencies |
| Strike activity and outcomes | Annual | BLS |
| ULP charges and outcomes | Quarterly | NLRB |

**Amendment Procedures**

1. **Statutory review**: Congress should review effectiveness every 5 years with mandatory GAO report

2. **Regulatory authority**: Grant agencies broad authority to address emerging loopholes through rulemaking

3. **Anti-circumvention**: Include general provisions prohibiting actions taken to evade statutory purposes

4. **Severability**: Include severability clauses to preserve remaining provisions if parts struck down

### General Implementation Concerns

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| NLRB capacity | $500M+ annual appropriation |
| FMCS arbitrator pool | Expand and train |
| Transition period | 90-180 days; guidance documents |
| Employer education | Compliance assistance programs |
| Worker education | Know your rights campaigns |
| State coordination | Model legislation, technical assistance |
