# Labor: Current State

## Overview

American workers face a crisis of power, protection, and prosperity. Union density has fallen to historic lows, wages have stagnated for decades relative to productivity, workplace protections lag peer nations, and the gig economy has created millions of workers without basic employment rights. While recent years have seen a resurgence in labor activism and public support for unions, structural barriers continue to limit worker power.
