# Labor: Overview

American workers face a crisis of power, protection, and prosperity. Union membership has collapsed from 35% in the 1950s to 10% today, leaving most workers without collective voice. The federal minimum wage hasn't been raised since 2009, wage theft extracts $15-50 billion annually from workers, and the gig economy has created a new class of workers without basic protections. Meanwhile, workplace safety enforcement remains inadequate, paid leave is unavailable to millions, and retirement security is increasingly precarious. This domain analyzes the structural causes of labor market dysfunction and proposes comprehensive reforms to restore worker power and protection.
