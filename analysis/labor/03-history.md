# Labor: History

## Overview

American labor history is a story of worker struggles for basic rights, hard-won protections, and the subsequent erosion of those gains. From early craft guilds through industrialization, the New Deal transformation, postwar prosperity, and neoliberal rollback, the balance of power between workers and employers has shifted dramatically. Understanding this history reveals both the fragility of labor rights and the conditions necessary to advance them.
