# Labor: Root Causes

## Overview

America's labor problems stem from interconnected legal, economic, political, and cultural factors that systematically disadvantage workers relative to employers. The legal framework structurally favors employers, economic changes have weakened worker bargaining power, political influence has tilted toward business interests, and cultural narratives have undermined collective action. Understanding these root causes reveals why incremental reforms consistently fail.

## Structural Causes

### Legal Framework Tilted Toward Employers

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **At-will employment default** | Employers can fire for any reason (except protected categories) |
| **NLRA exclusions** | Agricultural, domestic, gig workers lack protection |
| **Weak NLRA penalties** | Back pay only, no punitive damages |
| **Taft-Hartley restrictions** | Secondary boycotts banned, right-to-work enabled |
| **Slow NLRB process** | Elections delayed, violations unpunished for years |
| **Preemption doctrine** | States can't strengthen labor rights beyond NLRA |

### Fragmented Enforcement

| Agency | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| **NLRB** | 1,200 staff for 150 million+ workers |
| **WHD** | 780 investigators for 7.3 million establishments |
| **OSHA** | 750 inspectors for 8 million workplaces |
| **State agencies** | Underfunded, uneven coverage |
| **Remedies** | Civil only, no criminal penalties for most violations |

### Fissured Workplace

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Subcontracting** | Lead firms avoid employer responsibility |
| **Franchising** | Brand control without employment liability |
| **Temp agencies** | Triangular employment obscures responsibility |
| **Gig classification** | Workers classified as contractors |
| **Joint employer doctrine weakened** | Until 2023, lead firms insulated |

### Retirement System Shift

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Pension to 401(k)** | Risk shifted from employer to worker |
| **No universal mandate** | 45% of workers lack employer plan |
| **Portability gaps** | Job changes disrupt savings |
| **Leakage** | Early withdrawals, loans |
| **Fee structures** | Hidden costs erode returns |

## Economic Causes

### Power Imbalances

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Monopsony** | Concentrated employer power suppresses wages |
| **Labor market concentration** | Fewer employers = less competition for workers |
| **Non-compete agreements** | Limit worker mobility, suppress wages |
| **Information asymmetry** | Employers know more than workers |
| **Unemployment threat** | Fear of job loss disciplines workers |

### Globalization and Deindustrialization

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Offshoring** | Manufacturing jobs moved abroad |
| **Import competition** | Pressure on wages in tradable sectors |
| **Capital mobility** | Threat to relocate disciplines workers |
| **Supply chains** | Contractor relationships obscure responsibility |
| **Union density decline** | Lost manufacturing strongholds |

### Financialization

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Shareholder primacy** | Profits prioritized over workers |
| **Private equity** | Cost-cutting, layoffs, benefit reductions |
| **Stock buybacks** | Returns to shareholders vs. worker investment |
| **Short-term focus** | Quarterly earnings vs. workforce development |
| **Executive compensation** | Tied to stock price, not worker outcomes |

### Automation and Technology

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Labor-displacing technology** | Reduces bargaining power |
| **Surveillance technology** | Monitoring, discipline |
| **Algorithmic management** | Gig work, scheduling optimization |
| **Skills obsolescence** | Workers must constantly retrain |
| **Platform power** | Digital platforms control labor markets |

## Political Causes

### Business Political Dominance

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Campaign finance** | Business outspends labor 15:1 |
| **Lobbying** | 35+ business lobbyists per union lobbyist |
| **Revolving door** | Agency capture, favorable regulations |
| **PAC spending** | Labor can't match corporate resources |
| **Think tank funding** | Shapes policy discourse |

### Partisan Polarization

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Republican anti-union stance** | Consistent opposition to labor rights |
| **Democratic ambivalence** | Rhetoric vs. legislative priority |
| **Senate filibuster** | 60-vote threshold blocks reform |
| **Gerrymandering** | Anti-labor majorities in statehouses |
| **Right-to-work spread** | Now 27 states |

### NLRB Political Instability

| Administration | Approach |
|----------------|----------|
| **Obama NLRB** | Pro-worker rulings, expanded joint employer |
| **Trump NLRB** | Reversed pro-worker precedents |
| **Biden NLRB** | Restored and expanded worker protections |
| **Cycle continues** | Policies whipsaw with elections |

### Judicial Hostility

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Conservative courts** | Narrow labor law interpretation |
| **Janus decision** | Undermined public sector unions |
| **Arbitration expansion** | Class action waivers upheld |
| **Injunctions** | Courts side with employers on strikes |
| **Constitutional challenges** | NLRB authority questioned |

## Cultural Causes

### Individualist Ideology

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **American Dream narrative** | Success is individual, not collective |
| **Anti-collectivism** | Unions seen as against American values |
| **Self-reliance myth** | Ignores structural barriers |
| **Meritocracy belief** | Low wages seen as earned |
| **Free market ideology** | Government intervention seen as harmful |

### Employer Propaganda

| Tactic | Message |
|--------|---------|
| **Union as "third party"** | Divides workers from each other |
| **"Job creators"** | Employers deserve deference |
| **"Right to work"** | Freedom framing for union weakening |
| **"Flexibility"** | Masks insecurity as benefit |
| **"Family"** | Employer paternalism vs. worker solidarity |

### Weakened Class Consciousness

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Identity fragmentation** | Race, gender divide working class |
| **Geographic sorting** | Union strongholds emptied |
| **Generational change** | Younger workers never saw strong unions |
| **Media coverage** | Strikes portrayed negatively |
| **Education** | Labor history not taught |

### Stigmatization of Workers

| Belief | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **"Low-skill" workers** | All work requires skill |
| **"Entry-level" jobs** | Career jobs in service sector |
| **"Burger flipper" denigration** | Essential workers during pandemic |
| **Poverty as moral failing** | Structural causes ignored |
| **Unionized = lazy** | Union workers more productive |

## Interconnections

### Reinforcing Cycles

```text
Union Decline Cycle:
Weak legal protections → Low union density →
Less political power → Weaker legal protections →
Further union decline → Wages stagnate
```

```text
Enforcement Failure Cycle:
Underfunded agencies → Low detection →
Employers violate with impunity →
More violations → More resources needed →
Political opposition → Underfunding continues
```

```text
Inequality-Power Cycle:
Declining worker power → Wages stagnate →
Profits increase → Business political spending →
Anti-worker policy → Worker power declines further
```

### Cause Interactions

| Interaction | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| Structural + Political | Weak NLRA + business lobbying = no reform |
| Economic + Structural | Fissured workplace + legal gaps = no accountability |
| Cultural + Political | Individualism + campaign finance = anti-union policy |
| Economic + Cultural | Financialization + shareholder ideology = wage suppression |
| Structural + Economic | At-will employment + monopsony = worker powerlessness |

### Why Problems Persist

| Reason | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Beneficiaries have power** | Employers profit from status quo |
| **Collective action problems** | Unorganized workers can't coordinate |
| **Path dependence** | Legal framework hard to change |
| **Information asymmetry** | Workers don't know their rights |
| **Political capture** | Business interests dominate policy |
| **Cultural hegemony** | Anti-union narratives normalized |

## Causal Hierarchy

### Primary Causes (Most Fundamental)

| Cause | Why Primary |
|-------|-------------|
| **Legal framework** | Shapes all other dynamics |
| **Business political power** | Blocks reform, weakens enforcement |
| **Economic concentration** | Gives employers structural advantage |
| **Individualist ideology** | Undermines collective action |

### Secondary Causes (Derive from Primary)

| Cause | Derives From |
|-------|--------------|
| Union density decline | Legal framework + employer power |
| Wage stagnation | Concentration + weak bargaining |
| Enforcement gaps | Political power → underfunding |
| Gig classification | Legal gaps + employer lobbying |

### Tertiary Causes (Symptoms)

| Issue | Actually Caused By |
|-------|-------------------|
| Low minimum wage | Political power, not economics |
| Workplace injuries | Underfunding, not worker carelessness |
| Retirement insecurity | Policy choices, not individual failure |
| Wage theft | Weak enforcement, not bad actors |

---

## Why Markets Don't Self-Correct

| Market Failure | Explanation |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Monopsony** | Concentrated employer power not competed away |
| **Information asymmetry** | Workers can't assess employers accurately |
| **Collective action problems** | Individual workers can't bargain effectively |
| **Externalities** | Low wages impose costs on public programs |
| **Power dynamics** | Markets reflect power, not just efficiency |
| **Coordination failures** | Race to bottom without standards |

## Comparison to High-Functioning Systems

| Feature | U.S. | Northern Europe |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| **Union density** | 10% | 65-90% |
| **Collective bargaining coverage** | 12% | 70-95% |
| **Sectoral bargaining** | No | Yes |
| **Works councils** | No | Yes |
| **Codetermination** | No | Yes (board seats) |
| **Paid leave mandate** | No | Yes |
| **Minimum wage** | Federal $7.25 | Higher or sectoral |

### Why These Systems Work Better

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Legal support for unions** | Organizing easier |
| **Sectoral bargaining** | Takes wages out of competition |
| **Works councils** | Worker voice without unionization |
| **Social partnership ideology** | Less adversarial |
| **Political representation** | Labor parties in government |
