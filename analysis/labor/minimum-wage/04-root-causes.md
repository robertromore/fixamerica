# Minimum Wage: Root Causes

## Why the Minimum Wage Has Eroded

The federal minimum wage's purchasing power has declined over 40% since 1968 despite broad public support for increases. This erosion is not accidental but results from specific structural, political, and economic factors that have converged to block federal action while allowing inflation to steadily reduce the wage floor's real value.

## Structural Causes

### No Automatic Adjustment Mechanism

**The Core Design Flaw**

Unlike Social Security benefits, which are automatically indexed to inflation, the minimum wage requires affirmative congressional action for every increase. This design flaw means that the default outcome during any period of inaction is erosion.

| Program | Adjustment Mechanism | Result |
|---------|---------------------|--------|
| Social Security | Automatic COLA (since 1975) | Maintains real value |
| Federal minimum wage | Requires legislation | Erodes with inflation |
| Congressional salary | Automatic COLA (if not blocked) | Generally keeps pace |
| Military pay | Annual NDAA increases | Generally keeps pace |

**Cost of Congressional Dependence**

| Period Without Increase | Real Value Lost |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| 1981-1990 (9 years) | -27% |
| 1997-2007 (10 years) | -20% |
| 2009-2024 (15+ years) | -30%+ |

### The Filibuster

**Senate Supermajority Requirement**

The 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster has blocked minimum wage increases even when majorities support them.

| Year | House Vote | Senate Support | Outcome |
|------|------------|----------------|---------|
| 2014 | Not voted | 54 Democrats | Blocked by filibuster |
| 2019 | 231-199 pass | ~48 Democrats | No vote (McConnell) |
| 2021 | 231-199 pass | ~48 Democrats | Parliamentarian ruling/blocked |

**Reconciliation Limitations**

- Minimum wage cannot pass through budget reconciliation per Senate Parliamentarian ruling (2021)
- Requires 60 votes for regular legislation
- Vice President cannot overrule parliamentarian without political cost

### Federalism Creates a Safety Valve

**State Action Reduces Federal Pressure**

When states raise their minimums, workers in those states are protected but federal pressure decreases.

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Geographic concentration | Most minimum wage workers in federal-minimum states |
| Political distribution | Blue states raise wages, red states don't |
| Reduced urgency | Advocates in high-wage states less motivated |
| Talking point | "States can handle it themselves" |

**The Coverage Gap**

| Category | Approximate Workers |
|----------|---------------------|
| Workers in states at federal minimum | ~28 million |
| Workers in states above $10 but below $15 | ~42 million |
| Workers in states at or near $15 | ~60 million |

## Political Causes

### Partisan Polarization

**Historical Bipartisanship**

| Era | Republican Support | Democratic Support |
|----|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1938-1960 | Moderate | Strong |
| 1961-1980 | Moderate | Strong |
| 1981-1996 | Declining | Strong |
| 1997-Present | Minimal | Strong |

**Current Party Positions**

| Party | Position | Key Arguments |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Democrats | $15+ federal minimum | Worker dignity, poverty reduction |
| Republicans | No federal increase (state control) | Job losses, small business |

**Voting Patterns (2019 Raise the Wage Act)**

| Party | Yes | No |
|-------|-----|-----|
| Democrats | 228 | 6 |
| Republicans | 3 | 193 |

### Business Lobbying

**Organized Opposition**

| Organization | Position | Key Activities |
|--------------|----------|----------------|
| National Restaurant Association | Strongly opposed | Lobbying, campaign contributions |
| National Federation of Independent Business | Opposed | Grassroots mobilization |
| U.S. Chamber of Commerce | Opposed | Advertising, lobbying |
| International Franchise Association | Strongly opposed | Legal challenges |
| National Retail Federation | Opposed | Policy papers, lobbying |

**Campaign Contributions**

| Industry | Annual Political Spending | Primary Recipients |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Restaurant industry | $25+ million | Primarily Republican |
| Retail industry | $40+ million | Both parties |
| Franchise industry | $15+ million | Primarily Republican |

**Lobbying Expenditures on Labor Issues**

| Sector | Annual Lobbying (estimated) |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Food service | $10+ million |
| Retail | $15+ million |
| Small business associations | $8+ million |

### The Tipped Minimum Freeze

**Restaurant Industry Influence**

The National Restaurant Association (nicknamed "the other NRA") has been particularly effective at protecting the tipped minimum wage.

**Key Tactics**

1. **Tip income framing**: "Tipped workers earn more than minimum wage"
2. **Small business narrative**: "Family restaurants can't afford it"
3. **Server opposition**: Recruit servers who prefer tip system
4. **Regional variation**: "What works in NYC won't work in rural Alabama"
5. **Campaign support**: Significant donations to key legislators

**Results**

| Year | Regular Minimum | Tipped Minimum | Action |
|------|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| 1991 | $4.25 | $2.13 | Last tipped increase |
| 1996 | $5.15 | $2.13 | Frozen in compromise |
| 2007 | $7.25 | $2.13 | Not included |
| 2024 | $7.25 | $2.13 | Still frozen |

### Ideological Shift

**Market Fundamentalism**

Starting in the 1980s, the dominant economic ideology shifted against government intervention in labor markets.

| Period | Dominant View | Policy Implication |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1938-1970s | Labor market needs regulation | Regular minimum wage increases |
| 1980s-2000s | Markets self-correct | Skepticism of minimum wage |
| 2010s-Present | Evidence-based debate | Recognition of limited harm |

**Supply-Side Economics**

| Argument | Counter-Evidence |
|----------|------------------|
| Minimum wage kills jobs | Card-Krueger studies show minimal effect |
| Markets set efficient wages | Monopsony power depresses wages |
| Workers earn what they're worth | Productivity has far outpaced wages |
| Tax cuts help workers more | Benefits concentrated at top |

## Economic Causes

### Declining Union Power

**Union Membership and Political Influence**

| Year | Union Membership | Minimum Wage (2024 $) |
|------|------------------|----------------------|
| 1954 | 35% | $9.75 |
| 1968 | 28% | $13.00 |
| 1983 | 20% | $9.23 |
| 2000 | 13% | $9.22 |
| 2023 | 10% | $7.25 |

**Union Role in Minimum Wage**

| Function | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Political mobilization | Fewer resources for campaigns |
| Worker voice | Less pressure on legislators |
| Coalition building | Weaker alliances |
| Research/messaging | Reduced capacity |
| Strike threat | Limited leverage |

### Globalization and Competition

**Employer Mobility**

| Threat | Effect on Minimum Wage Debate |
|--------|------------------------------|
| Offshoring jobs | "Raises will send jobs overseas" |
| Automation | "Robots will replace workers" |
| Import competition | "Need low wages to compete" |
| Franchise model | "Small franchisees can't afford it" |

**Reality Check**

| Job Type | Offshorable? |
|----------|--------------|
| Fast food | No |
| Retail sales | No |
| Home health aides | No |
| Childcare | No |
| Agriculture | Mostly no |

Most minimum wage jobs are inherently local and cannot be offshored, but the threat narrative persists.

### Monopsony Power

**Employer Concentration**

In many labor markets, a small number of employers dominate, giving them wage-setting power.

| Market Characteristic | Effect on Wages |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Few employers | Workers have fewer options |
| Geographic isolation | Can't seek better offers |
| Occupational licensing | Limits mobility |
| Non-compete agreements | Traps workers |
| Information asymmetry | Workers don't know alternatives |

**Implications for Minimum Wage**

When employers have monopsony power, they can pay below competitive wages. A minimum wage can actually *increase* employment by forcing wages toward the competitive level.

## Social and Cultural Causes

### Stereotypes About Minimum Wage Workers

**Common Misconceptions**

| Myth | Reality |
|------|---------|
| "Mostly teenagers" | 52% are 25 or older |
| "Just for pocket money" | Many are family breadwinners |
| "Temporary jobs" | Average tenure 3+ years |
| "Stepping stones" | Many remain low-wage long-term |
| "Students" | Majority are not in school |

**How Stereotypes Affect Policy**

- Reduce urgency ("They don't really need more")
- Justify inaction ("It's not a real job anyway")
- Shift blame to workers ("They should get better jobs")
- Obscure racial/gender dimensions ("It's about skill, not discrimination")

### Racial Dimensions

**Discriminatory Origins**

The 1938 FLSA deliberately excluded occupations dominated by Black workers (agriculture, domestic service). This historical exclusion contributed to persistent racial inequality.

| Occupation (1938) | Covered? | % Black Workers |
|-------------------|----------|-----------------|
| Manufacturing | Yes | 10% |
| Mining | Yes | 8% |
| Agriculture | No | 50% |
| Domestic service | No | 60% |

**Continuing Disparities**

| Racial Group | % at Minimum Wage | % of Workforce |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Black | 15% | 12% |
| Hispanic | 17% | 18% |
| White | 71% | 77% |

**Racialized Resistance**

Research suggests that some opposition to minimum wage increases is connected to racial resentment, as increases disproportionately benefit workers of color.

### Gender Dimensions

**Women's Overrepresentation**

| Category | Women's Share |
|----------|---------------|
| Workforce | 47% |
| Minimum wage workers | 57% |
| Tipped workers | 66% |
| Restaurant servers | 70% |

**Historical Connection**

Early minimum wage laws only covered women and children, partly because women's work was seen as less valuable. This legacy persists in the gendered structure of low-wage work.

## Institutional Causes

### Congressional Dysfunction

**General Legislative Gridlock**

| Factor | Effect on Minimum Wage |
|--------|----------------------|
| Partisan polarization | No bipartisan deals |
| Filibuster | 60-vote threshold |
| Short sessions | Limited floor time |
| Leadership control | Bills don't reach floor |
| Electoral concerns | Avoid controversial votes |

**Committee Control**

The House Education and Labor Committee and Senate HELP Committee control minimum wage legislation. Committee chairs can block bills from moving.

### Media and Information Environment

**Coverage Patterns**

| Frame | Frequency | Effect |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| "Job killer" | High | Builds opposition |
| "Workers can't survive" | Medium | Builds support |
| "Economic debate" | High | Both-sides neutrality |
| "Business concerns" | High | Legitimizes opposition |
| "Worker stories" | Lower | Humanizes issue |

**False Balance**

Media coverage often presents the minimum wage as a genuine economic debate when the scholarly consensus increasingly supports moderate increases.

| Coverage Element | Problem |
|------------------|---------|
| "Economists disagree" | Most support modest increases |
| Industry spokesman quotes | Treated as neutral expertise |
| CBO uncertainty ranges | Worst-case highlighted |
| Restaurant workers opposing | Unrepresentative voices amplified |

## Why the Status Quo Persists

### Whose Interests Are Served

**Winners from Stagnation**

| Group | Benefit |
|-------|---------|
| Low-wage employers | Lower labor costs |
| Shareholders | Higher profits |
| Consumers | Slightly lower prices |
| Competing workers | Less wage pressure (arguable) |

**Losers from Stagnation**

| Group | Cost |
|-------|------|
| Minimum wage workers | Declining living standards |
| Taxpayers | Subsidize employers via public assistance |
| Local economies | Reduced consumer spending |
| Society | Increased inequality, social costs |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Structural flaw**: No indexing means erosion is default outcome
2. **Filibuster barrier**: 60-vote threshold blocks popular increases
3. **Business influence**: Industry lobbying outspends worker advocacy
4. **Partisan division**: Once bipartisan, now party-line issue
5. **Union decline**: Less political muscle for worker priorities
6. **Ideological shift**: Market fundamentalism opposed intervention
7. **Racial/gender dimensions**: Low-wage work disproportionately women and minorities
8. **Self-reinforcing**: Low wages reduce worker political power
