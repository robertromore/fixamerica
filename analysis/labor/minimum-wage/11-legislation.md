# Minimum Wage: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

This document provides draft legislation for comprehensive minimum wage reform, including federal legislation to raise the wage floor, eliminate the tipped minimum wage, index to inflation, and strengthen enforcement. Also included is model state legislation and analysis of loopholes and shortcomings.

## Federal Legislation

### Raise the Wage Act

**Purpose**: Raise the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour, eliminate the tipped and subminimum wages, and index to median wages.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Raise the Wage Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 per hour since
    July 24, 2009, the longest period without an increase
    since the minimum wage was established in 1938.
(2) Adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage has lost more
    than 40 percent of its purchasing power since 1968.
(3) A full-time minimum wage worker earns $15,080 per year,
    placing a family of three below the federal poverty line.
(4) Approximately 32 million workers would benefit from
    raising the minimum wage to $17 per hour.
(5) Women, who make up 57 percent of minimum wage workers,
    would disproportionately benefit from an increase.
(6) The tipped minimum wage of $2.13 per hour has not
    increased since 1991, leaving tipped workers vulnerable
    to income volatility and poverty.
(7) Economic research demonstrates that moderate minimum wage
    increases have minimal negative employment effects.
(8) States that have raised their minimum wages have
    experienced continued job growth.

SEC. 3. MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE.

Section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938
(29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)) is amended to read as follows:

than—
    "(A) $10.00 an hour, beginning on the first day of the
        third month after the date of enactment of the

(a) NOTICE REQUIREMENT.—Before taking a tip credit, an
    employer must inform each tipped employee:
    (1) The amount of the direct wage the employer will
        pay, which must be at least $2.13 per hour;

    records showing:
    (1) Daily tip income reported by each employee;

(b) FACTORS.—In determining whether a person exercises
    significant control, the following factors shall be
    considered:
    (1) Whether the person has power to hire or fire the
        employee or significantly affects hiring or firing;
    (2) Whether the person supervises and controls the
        employee's work schedules or conditions of
        employment to a substantial degree;
    (3) Whether the person determines the rate and method
        of payment;
    (4) Whether the person maintains employment records;
    (5) Whether the person provides the tools or materials
        used by the employee;
    (6) Whether the person has significant control over
        the economic terms of employment, such as through
        franchise agreements, supply contracts, or service
        agreements that effectively dictate wage rates.

(c) FRANCHISE RELATIONSHIPS.—A franchisor may be a joint
    employer with its franchisee if the franchisor exercises
    direct or indirect control over the terms and conditions
    of employment of the franchisee's employees.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Federal minimum wage | Well-established under *United States v. Darby* (1941) |
| Coverage of state employees | Upheld in *Garcia v. San Antonio* (1985) |
| Tip credit regulation | Within FLSA authority |

**State Preemption of Local Action**

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| State preemption of local minimums | Generally constitutional |
| Home rule challenges | Vary by state constitution |
| Federal preemption of state preemption | Not applicable to higher standards |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| DOL investigation | Expert agency | Limited resources |
| Private lawsuits | Worker-initiated | Expensive, risky |
| State enforcement | Local presence | Varies by state |
| Criminal penalties | Deterrent | Rarely used |

### Sunset and Review Provisions

**Recommended**:

- GAO study of employment effects after 5 years
- Annual reporting on enforcement outcomes
- Automatic indexing review every 10 years
- Regional adjustment review every 5 years

| Collection difficulty | Judgments may be uncollectible | Asset hiding |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Corporate veil**: Personal liability for officers with knowledge; successor employer liability

4. **Proxy retaliation**: Include "any person" in retaliation prohibition
5. **Statute of limitations**: Discovery rule; tolling for fear of retaliation
6. **Criminal enforcement**: Mandatory referral for large-scale theft; dedicated prosecutors

### State Model Legislation

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Preemption in other states | Workers in preemption states remain unprotected | High |
| Border effects | Employers relocate across state lines | Low-Medium |
| Federal minimum floor | State increase cannot help if federal enforcement weakens | Medium |

| Inflation erosion | Non-indexed minimums | Mandatory indexing in all legislation |
| Enforcement capacity | All provisions | Dedicated, protected funding |
| Employer evasion | All provisions | Joint employer liability; misclassification crackdown |
| Technological change | Future workforce | Regular review and update provisions |

#### Monitoring Requirements

| Metric | Frequency | Entity |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Minimum wage workers | Annual | BLS |
| Violation rates | Quarterly | DOL |
| Employment in affected industries | Monthly | BLS |
| Living wage calculations | Annual | MIT/academic |
| Enforcement outcomes | Annual | DOL |
