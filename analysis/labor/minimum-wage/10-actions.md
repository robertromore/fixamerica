```text
Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City].

I'm calling to urge [Representative/Senator] to support
raising the federal minimum wage to at least $15 per hour.

The minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009 -
that's over 15 years without an increase. Workers can't
survive on poverty wages.

I'd like to know: Does [Representative/Senator] support
the Raise the Wage Act?

Thank you for your time.
```

**Sample Letter Template**

```text
[Your Address]
[Date]

The Honorable [Name]
[Office Address]

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name]:

I am writing as your constituent to urge you to support
raising the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour with
automatic indexing to inflation.

[Personal story or local impact]

The federal minimum wage of $7.25 has not increased since
2009 - the longest period without an increase in history.
Meanwhile, prices have risen over 40%, leaving minimum
wage workers unable to meet basic needs.

Specifically, I ask that you:
1. Co-sponsor the Raise the Wage Act
2. Support eliminating the tipped minimum wage
3. Vote yes when minimum wage legislation reaches the floor

Thank you for considering my views on this important issue.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
```
