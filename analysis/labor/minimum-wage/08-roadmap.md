# Minimum Wage: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines a realistic strategy for achieving meaningful minimum wage reform in the United States. Given the structural barriers to federal action, the strategy emphasizes a multi-track approach: continuing state and local campaigns while building pressure for federal action.

## Strategic Framework

### Multi-Track Strategy

```text

Track 1: Federal Legislation
├── Build Senate majority for reform
├── Filibuster reform or reconciliation path
└── Presidential executive actions

Track 2: State Action
├── Ballot initiatives in initiative states
├── Legislative campaigns in blue/purple states
└── Prevent preemption in local-control states

Track 3: Local Action
├── City minimum wage campaigns
├── Living wage ordinances for contractors
└── Challenge preemption laws

Track 4: Private Sector
├── Corporate campaigns
├── Worker organizing
└── Shareholder advocacy

```
