# Minimum Wage: History

## Origins of the Minimum Wage

### Early Wage Floor Movements

**Progressive Era Context (1890s-1920s)**

The movement for minimum wage laws emerged from Progressive Era concerns about "sweating" - the exploitation of workers, particularly women and children, in unregulated industries.

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1894 | New Zealand enacts first national minimum wage |
| 1896 | Victoria, Australia establishes wage boards |
| 1909 | United Kingdom enacts Trade Boards Act |
| 1912 | Massachusetts passes first U.S. state minimum wage law (women only) |
| 1913 | Eight more states pass minimum wage laws for women |

**Constitutional Challenges**

| Case | Year | Outcome |
|------|------|---------|
| *Muller v. Oregon* | 1908 | Upheld limits on women's work hours |
| *Adkins v. Children's Hospital* | 1923 | Struck down DC minimum wage for women |
| *West Coast Hotel v. Parrish* | 1937 | Upheld state minimum wage, overturning *Adkins* |

### Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938

**New Deal Context**

The Great Depression created political conditions for federal wage legislation. President Franklin Roosevelt championed the Fair Labor Standards Act as part of the New Deal.

**Roosevelt's Statement (1938)**:

> "No business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country."

**Original FLSA Provisions**

| Provision | Initial Standard |
|-----------|------------------|
| Minimum wage | $0.25/hour |
| Maximum hours before overtime | 44 hours/week |
| Overtime rate | 1.5x regular pay |
| Child labor | Prohibited under 16 in most industries |

**Coverage Limitations (1938)**

| Workers Covered | Workers Excluded |
|-----------------|------------------|
| ~20% of workforce | Agriculture |
| Manufacturing | Domestic service |
| Mining | Retail |
| Interstate commerce | Small businesses |

**Phased Increases**

| Year | Minimum Wage |
|------|--------------|
| 1938 | $0.25 |
| 1939 | $0.30 |
| 1945 | $0.40 |

## The Golden Age of the Minimum Wage (1950-1968)

### Expansion and Growth

**Coverage Expansion**

| Year | Amendment | Coverage Change |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1949 | FLSA Amendment | Raised wage to $0.75 |
| 1955 | FLSA Amendment | Raised wage to $1.00 |
| 1961 | FLSA Amendment | Extended to retail, construction |
| 1966 | FLSA Amendment | Extended to state/local government, hospitals, schools |
| 1974 | FLSA Amendment | Extended to domestic workers |

**Regular Increases**

| Year | Minimum Wage | 2024 Dollars |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| 1950 | $0.75 | $9.75 |
| 1956 | $1.00 | $11.48 |
| 1961 | $1.15 | $12.02 |
| 1963 | $1.25 | $12.75 |
| 1967 | $1.40 | $13.09 |
| 1968 | $1.60 | $14.09 (peak) |

### 1968: Peak Purchasing Power

The minimum wage reached its highest real value in February 1968 at $1.60 per hour.

**What $1.60/hour Meant in 1968**

| Measure | 1968 Value |
|---------|------------|
| Annual income (full-time) | $3,328 |
| Median family income | $8,632 |
| Minimum wage as % of median | 39% |
| Poverty line (family of 4) | $3,553 |
| Minimum wage as % of poverty | 94% |

**Why 1968 Was the Peak**

- Strong labor movement (28% union membership)
- Bipartisan support for increases
- Regular congressional action
- Lower income inequality overall
- Civil rights movement raised awareness of working poverty

## The Long Decline (1968-2009)

### Inflation Erosion

After 1968, minimum wage increases became less frequent and failed to keep pace with inflation.

| Period | Minimum Wage Changes | Real Value Change |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1968-1974 | Frozen at $1.60 | -23% |
| 1974-1981 | Raised to $3.35 | +12% recovery |
| 1981-1990 | Frozen at $3.35 | -27% |
| 1990-1997 | Raised to $5.15 | +17% recovery |
| 1997-2007 | Frozen at $5.15 | -20% |
| 2007-2009 | Raised to $7.25 | +14% recovery |
| 2009-2024 | Frozen at $7.25 | -30%+ |

### The Tipped Minimum Wage

**Creation and Erosion**

| Year | Tipped Minimum | Regular Minimum | Tipped as % |
|------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1966 | $0.63 | $1.25 | 50% |
| 1980 | $2.55 | $3.10 | 82% |
| 1990 | $2.01 | $3.80 | 53% |
| 1991 | $2.13 | $4.25 | 50% |
| 1996 | $2.13 | $4.75 | 45% |
| 2009 | $2.13 | $7.25 | 29% |
| 2024 | $2.13 | $7.25 | 29% |

**1996: The Great Decoupling**

The 1996 minimum wage increase included a compromise that froze the tipped minimum at $2.13. This decoupling from the regular minimum wage has made the tipped minimum increasingly inadequate.

### Key Legislative History

**1989-1991 Increase**

| Event | Date | Result |
|-------|------|--------|
| Bush vetoes $4.55 minimum | June 1989 | Congress failed to override |
| Compromise reached | November 1989 | $3.80 in 1990, $4.25 in 1991 |
| Training wage created | 1989 | Subminimum for first 60 days |

**1996 Increase**

| Event | Date | Result |
|-------|------|--------|
| Republican Congress | 1995 | Blocked increases |
| Election year pressure | 1996 | $4.75, then $5.15 |
| Tipped wage frozen | 1996 | Remained at $2.13 |
| Small business tax cuts | 1996 | Part of deal |

**2007 Increase**

| Event | Date | Result |
|-------|------|--------|
| Democrats take Congress | November 2006 | Minimum wage priority |
| Passed with Iraq bill | May 2007 | Three-step increase |
| $5.85 | July 2007 | First increase |
| $6.55 | July 2008 | Second increase |
| $7.25 | July 2009 | Final increase |

## The Fight for $15 Era (2012-Present)

### Origins of the Movement

**Fast Food Worker Strikes (2012)**

| Date | Location | Participants |
|------|----------|--------------|
| November 2012 | New York City | 200 fast food workers |
| April 2013 | Chicago | Expanded strikes |
| August 2013 | 60 cities | National day of action |
| December 2013 | 100 cities | Largest fast food strike |

**Why $15?**

- Approximately matches 1968 minimum wage adjusted for productivity
- Round number with symbolic power
- Living wage calculations supported the level
- SEIU research and strategy

| Benchmark | 2024 Equivalent |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Inflation from 1968 | $13.00 |
| Inflation from 1938 | $5.55 |

| Productivity from 1948 | $26.00 |
| Top 1% income growth | $40.00+ |
| CEO pay growth | $33.00 |

## Historical Precedents and Lessons

### What Worked

**Post-War Era (1945-1968)**

- Regular increases (every 2-3 years)
- Bipartisan support
- Strong union advocacy
- Coverage expansion alongside increases
- Linked to economic growth

**State-Level Success (2012-Present)**

- Ballot initiatives bypassing legislatures
- City-level leadership creating momentum
- Phased increases with indexing
- Coalition building (workers, faith groups, economists)

### What Failed

**The Freeze Pattern**

| Freeze Period | Duration | Real Value Lost |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| 1981-1990 | 9 years | -27% |
| 1997-2007 | 10 years | -20% |
| 2009-Present | 15+ years | -30%+ |

**Failed Proposals**

| Year | Proposed Level | Result |
|------|----------------|--------|
| 1989 | $4.55 | Bush veto |
| 2005 | $7.25 | Blocked in GOP Congress |
| 2014 | $10.10 | Blocked in Senate |
| 2019 | $15.00 | Blocked in Senate |
| 2021 | $15.00 | Parliamentarian ruling/Manchin opposition |

### Economic Research Evolution

**Classical View (Pre-1990s)**

- Standard economic theory predicted job losses
- Minimum wage seen as price floor causing unemployment
- Little empirical testing

**Card-Krueger Revolution (1990s)**

| Study | Year | Finding |
|-------|------|---------|
| Card & Krueger (NJ fast food) | 1994 | No job loss from increase |
| Card & Krueger (PA-NJ border) | 1995 | Employment actually rose |
| Neumark & Wascher critique | 1995-2000 | Contested methodology |
| Card & Krueger response | 2000 | Original findings robust |

**Modern Consensus**

| Research Finding | Source |
|-----------------|--------|
| Modest increases have minimal employment effects | Dube, Lester, Reich (2010) |
| Local area studies show positive effects | Cengiz et al. (2019) |
| Monopsony power means raises can increase employment | Manning (2003) |
| Effects vary by local labor market | Neumark (2018) |

## Key Historical Lessons

### Why the Minimum Wage Eroded

1. **No automatic indexing**: Requires congressional action each time
2. **Filibuster**: Senate rules enable minority obstruction
3. **Business lobbying**: Restaurant/retail industry opposition
4. **Partisan polarization**: Became identified with Democrats
5. **Federalism**: States could go higher, reducing federal pressure
6. **Economic ideology**: Market fundamentalism opposed intervention

### What History Shows

1. **Regular increases work**: Pre-1968 pattern maintained value
2. **Long freezes devastate**: Every freeze destroys purchasing power
3. **States can lead**: State action creates pressure and demonstrates feasibility
4. **Workers must organize**: Movement power essential for political change
5. **Research matters**: Card-Krueger changed the debate
6. **Indexing is crucial**: Only way to prevent future erosion
