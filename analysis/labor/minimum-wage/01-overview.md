# Minimum Wage: Overview

## Executive Summary

The federal minimum wage has been frozen at $7.25 per hour since July 24, 2009, making this the longest period in American history without an increase. At $15,080 per year for a full-time worker, the federal minimum wage leaves a family of three below the poverty line. Adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage has lost over 40% of its purchasing power since its 1968 peak, when it was equivalent to approximately $13 in today's dollars. Meanwhile, 30 states and numerous localities have enacted their own higher minimums, creating a patchwork system where a worker's wage floor depends entirely on geography.

The minimum wage debate sits at the intersection of economic policy, labor rights, and poverty reduction. Supporters argue that no one working full-time should live in poverty and that higher wages boost consumer spending and reduce reliance on public assistance. Opponents contend that mandated wage floors harm small businesses, reduce employment, and hurt the workers they intend to help. Decades of economic research, particularly the landmark Card-Krueger studies, have challenged traditional assumptions about employment effects, showing that moderate minimum wage increases have little negative impact on jobs.

## The Core Problem

### A Wage Floor That No Longer Functions

The minimum wage was established in 1938 to ensure that workers could meet basic needs through full-time employment. For decades, it succeeded: minimum wage increases kept pace with inflation and productivity, and a full-time minimum wage job could support a family above poverty.

Today, that fundamental purpose has been abandoned.

| Minimum Wage Measure | Value |
|---------------------|-------|
| Current federal minimum | $7.25/hour |
| Annual income (full-time) | $15,080 |
| Federal poverty line (single adult) | $15,060 |
| Federal poverty line (family of 3) | $23,030 |
| Percentage of poverty (family of 3) | 65% |

### The Great Erosion

**Peak Purchasing Power**: In 1968, the minimum wage reached its inflation-adjusted peak, equivalent to approximately $12-13 in 2024 dollars.

**Productivity Disconnect**: If the minimum wage had kept pace with productivity growth since 1968, it would exceed $24 per hour today.

| Year | Nominal Minimum | 2024 Dollars | Productivity-Adjusted |
|------|-----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| 1968 | $1.60 | $13.00 | $24.00+ |
| 1980 | $3.10 | $11.79 | - |
| 1997 | $5.15 | $10.06 | - |
| 2009 | $7.25 | $10.37 | - |
| 2024 | $7.25 | $7.25 | - |

### A Tale of Two Americas

While the federal minimum has stagnated, states and localities have created vastly different wage floors.

**High-Wage States (2024)**

| State | Minimum Wage |
|-------|--------------|
| Washington | $16.28 |
| California | $16.00 |
| New York | $16.00 |
| Massachusetts | $15.00 |
| Connecticut | $15.69 |

**Federal Minimum States (2024)**

| State | Minimum Wage |
|-------|--------------|
| Texas | $7.25 |
| Pennsylvania | $7.25 |
| Wisconsin | $7.25 |
| North Carolina | $7.25 |
| Georgia | $7.25 (state) |

This geographic disparity means a worker doing identical work can earn over $9 more per hour simply by crossing a state line.

## By the Numbers

### Who Earns Minimum Wage

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Workers at or below federal minimum | 1.3 million |
| Workers earning under $15/hour | 32 million |
| Percentage of hourly workers at/below minimum | 1.3% |
| Percentage earning under $15/hour | ~20% |

### Demographics

| Demographic | Share of Minimum Wage Workers |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| Women | 57% |
| Workers 25 and older | 48% |
| Part-time workers | 63% |
| White | 71% |
| Black | 15% |
| Hispanic | 17% |

### Industries

| Industry | Share of Minimum Wage Workers |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Food service | 44% |
| Retail | 14% |
| Leisure and hospitality | 12% |
| Personal services | 8% |
| Agriculture | 3% |

### The Tipped Minimum Wage

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Federal tipped minimum | $2.13/hour |
| Years unchanged | 33 (since 1991) |
| States with full minimum for tipped workers | 7 |
| Tipped workers in poverty | 12.8% |
| Poverty rate for all workers | 6.5% |

## Key Concepts

### Minimum Wage vs. Living Wage

**Minimum Wage**: The legal floor below which employers cannot pay

**Living Wage**: The hourly rate needed to meet basic needs (food, housing, healthcare, transportation, childcare)

| Location | Minimum Wage | Living Wage (1 Adult) | Gap |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|-----|
| National average | $7.25 | $21.54 | $14.29 |
| California | $16.00 | $21.24 | $5.24 |
| Texas | $7.25 | $18.73 | $11.48 |
| New York City | $16.00 | $26.69 | $10.69 |

### Automatic Indexing

Many states and countries tie their minimum wage to automatic adjustments:

| Type | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| CPI indexing | Adjusts annually for inflation |
| Median wage indexing | Sets minimum as percentage of median wage |
| Productivity indexing | Ties to economic output growth |

**States with Automatic Indexing**: California, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington

### Employment Effects Debate

| Position | Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Classical economics | Higher wages reduce employment | Theoretical models |
| Card-Krueger research | Moderate increases have minimal employment effects | Empirical studies of state border comparisons |
| Monopsony theory | Wage floors can increase employment when employers have market power | Labor economics theory |

### Factors Affecting Minimum Wage Policy

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Congressional inaction | Federal minimum frozen |
| Business lobbying | Blocks increases |
| State-level action | Creates patchwork |
| Ballot initiatives | Bypass legislative gridlock |
| Worker organizing | Fight for $15 pressure |
| Cost of living | Drives local variation |

## Why This Matters

### For Low-Wage Workers

- 32 million Americans earn less than $15/hour
- Full-time work does not guarantee escape from poverty
- Women and people of color disproportionately affected
- Tipped workers face extreme income volatility

### For the Economy

- Low wages reduce consumer spending power
- Taxpayers subsidize low-wage employers through public assistance
- Walmart and McDonald's workers receive billions in SNAP and Medicaid
- Higher wages can reduce turnover and increase productivity

### For Racial and Gender Equity

- Women are 57% of minimum wage workers
- Black workers are 15% of minimum wage workers (12% of workforce)
- Minimum wage increases disproportionately benefit women and minorities
- Eliminating tipped minimum wage would particularly benefit women

### For Business and Employment

- Small businesses face different impacts than large corporations
- Regional variation affects competitive dynamics
- Research suggests modest employment effects from moderate increases
- Higher wages can reduce turnover costs
