# Minimum Wage: Current State

## The Problem Today

### Federal Minimum Wage

**Current Rate**: $7.25 per hour since July 24, 2009

The federal minimum wage has now been frozen for over 15 years, the longest period without an increase since the minimum wage was established in 1938. During this time, inflation has eroded approximately 30% of its purchasing power.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Hourly rate | $7.25 |
| Weekly income (40 hours) | $290 |
| Monthly income | $1,257 |
| Annual income (full-time, 2,080 hours) | $15,080 |
| Federal poverty line (single adult, 2024) | $15,060 |
| Federal poverty line (family of 3) | $23,030 |
| Federal poverty line (family of 4) | $31,200 |

**Relationship to Poverty**

| Family Size | Poverty Line | Minimum Wage Income | % of Poverty |
|-------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|
| 1 adult | $15,060 | $15,080 | 100% |
| 2 people | $20,440 | $15,080 | 74% |
| 3 people | $23,030 | $15,080 | 65% |
| 4 people | $31,200 | $15,080 | 48% |

### Purchasing Power Decline

**Inflation-Adjusted Value**

| Year | Nominal Minimum | 2024 Dollars |

| 1968 (peak) | $1.60 | $13.00 |
| 1974 | $2.00 | $12.07 |
| 1980 | $3.10 | $11.79 |
| 1990 | $3.80 | $9.14 |
| 1997 | $5.15 | $10.06 |

| 2009 | $7.25 | $10.37 |
| 2015 | $7.25 | $9.29 |
| 2020 | $7.25 | $8.54 |
| 2024 | $7.25 | $7.25 |

**If Minimum Wage Had Kept Pace**

| Benchmark | 2024 Equivalent |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Inflation since 1968 | ~$13.00 |
| Productivity since 1968 | ~$24.00 |
| CEO compensation since 1978 | ~$33.00 |
| Congressional salary | $15.80 (based on their own increases) |
