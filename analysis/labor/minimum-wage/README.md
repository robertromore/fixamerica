# Minimum Wage: Overview

The federal minimum wage has been frozen at $7.25 per hour since July 24, 2009, making this the longest period in American history without an increase. At $15,080 per year for a full-time worker, the federal minimum wage leaves a family of three below the poverty line. Adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage has lost over 40% of its purchasing power since its 1968 peak, when it was equivalent to approximately $13 in today's dollars. Meanwhile, 30 states and numerous localities have enacted their own higher minimums, creating a patchwork system where a worker's wage floor depends entirely on geography.
