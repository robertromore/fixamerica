# Minimum Wage: Solutions

## Overview

This document presents solutions to restore the minimum wage as an effective tool for ensuring that work provides a decent standard of living. The proposals address both the immediate need to raise the wage floor and the structural reforms needed to prevent future erosion.

## Core Principles

### Design Principles for Minimum Wage Reform

| Principle | Implication |
|-----------|-------------|
| Living wage standard | Should allow full-time workers to meet basic needs |
| Automatic adjustment | Prevent erosion through indexing |
| One Fair Wage | Eliminate tipped and subminimum wages |
| Broad coverage | Minimize exemptions |
| Enforcement | Adequate resources and strong penalties |
| Transition support | Phase-in periods and small business assistance |

## Federal Minimum Wage Solutions

### Solution 1: Raise the Federal Minimum to $17

**Proposal**

Increase the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour by 2028, then index to inflation or median wages (whichever is greater).

**Implementation Timeline**

| Date | Minimum Wage |
|------|--------------|
| Enactment + 90 days | $10.00 |
| Year 1 | $12.00 |
| Year 2 | $14.00 |
| Year 3 | $15.50 |
| Year 4 | $17.00 |
| Year 5+ | Indexed annually |

**Rationale**

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 1968 peak adjusted for inflation | ~$13 |
| 1968 peak adjusted for productivity | ~$24 |
| $17 as compromise | Between inflation and productivity |
| Living wage (national average, 1 adult) | ~$21 |

**Evidence Base**

- States that have raised minimum wage to $15+ show no significant job losses
- Card-Krueger research demonstrates minimal employment effects
- Consumer spending increases offset some labor cost increases

### Solution 2: Inflation Indexing

**Proposal**

Require automatic annual adjustments to the minimum wage based on cost of living changes.

**Indexing Options**

| Index | Mechanism | Pros | Cons |
|-------|-----------|------|------|
| CPI-W | Inflation for wage earners | Reflects worker costs | May lag actual costs |
| CPI-U | General inflation | Broader measure | Less worker-specific |
| Median wage | 50% of median | Maintains relativity | More ambitious |
| Greater of CPI or median | Best of both | Prevents erosion | More politically difficult |

**Indexing Formula**

```text
New Minimum = Prior Minimum x (1 + Index Change)

Example: If CPI increased 3% and prior minimum was $17:
New Minimum = $17 x 1.03 = $17.51

Rounded to nearest $0.05: $17.50
```

**State Models**

| State | Index | Results |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Washington | CPI-W | Maintained real value since 1998 |
| California | CPI | Scheduled increases + indexing |
| Oregon | CPI | Regional adjustments |
| Colorado | CPI | Voter-approved in 2016 |

### Solution 3: Regional Adjustment

**Proposal**

Establish a federal minimum with regional adjustments based on local cost of living.

**Model Structure**

| Region Type | Minimum Wage | Formula |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| High cost metro | Base + 30% | $17 + $5.10 = $22.10 |
| Metro average | Base + 10% | $17 + $1.70 = $18.70 |
| National baseline | Base | $17.00 |
| Low cost rural | Base | $17.00 (floor) |

**Implementation Options**

1. **BLS Regional Price Parities**: Use existing federal data
2. **County-level calculation**: More precise but complex
3. **State self-adjustment**: States can add to federal base
4. **Metro area adjustment**: Higher minimums in high-cost metros

**Advantages and Concerns**

| Advantage | Concern |
|-----------|---------|
| Addresses regional variation | Administrative complexity |
| Makes federal minimum more acceptable to all areas | Potential for gaming |
| Aligns with living wage concept | Political challenges in defining regions |

## Tipped Minimum Wage Solutions

### Solution 4: One Fair Wage

**Proposal**

Eliminate the tipped minimum wage and require all workers receive the full minimum wage before tips.

**Phase-Out Schedule**

| Year | Tipped Minimum | Regular Minimum |
|------|----------------|-----------------|

| Year 1 | $4.00 | $10.00 |
| Year 2 | $6.00 | $12.00 |
| Year 3 | $8.00 | $14.00 |
| Year 4 | $11.00 | $15.50 |
| Year 5 | $17.00 | $17.00 |

**Evidence from Equal Treatment States**

| State | Tipped Minimum | Restaurant Employment Growth |
|-------|----------------|------------------------------|
| California | Full minimum | Above national average |
| Washington | Full minimum | Above national average |
| Oregon | Full minimum | Above national average |
| Montana | Full minimum | Comparable to national |
| Minnesota | Full minimum | Above national average |
| Nevada | Full minimum | Above national average |
