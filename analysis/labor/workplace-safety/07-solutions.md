# Workplace Safety: Solutions

## Overview

Addressing America's workplace safety crisis requires comprehensive reform across multiple dimensions: dramatically expanding OSHA's enforcement capacity, strengthening penalties to create real deterrence, protecting workers who report hazards, closing coverage gaps, and establishing standards for emerging hazards like heat illness and algorithmic management. The goal is a workplace safety system that prevents harm rather than merely documenting it after the fact.

## Enforcement Capacity

### Expand Inspector Corps

**Current Gap**:

| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Federal inspectors | ~1,850 | 10,000 | 5x increase |
| State inspectors | ~1,100 | 5,000 | 4.5x increase |
| Total inspectors | ~2,950 | 15,000 | 5x increase |

**Implementation**:

- Phase in over 5-7 years
- Hire from safety professionals, labor advocates, affected communities
- Increase salaries to compete with private sector
- Expand training capacity

**Impact**: Reduce time between inspections from 165 years to 30 years (minimum).

### Increase OSHA Budget

**Proposed Budget Increase**:

| Category | Current | Target | Increase |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|
| Total OSHA budget | $680M | $3B | 4.5x |
| Inspection capacity | $350M | $1.5B | 4x |
| Standard-setting | $50M | $200M | 4x |
| Compliance assistance | $100M | $300M | 3x |
| State plan support | $100M | $500M | 5x |

**Funding Mechanisms**:

- General appropriations increase
- Dedicated funding stream from penalties
- Employer fee on workers' comp premiums

### Target High-Hazard Industries

**Priority Inspection Sectors**:

| Sector | Current Inspections | Target | Focus Areas |
|--------|---------------------|--------|-------------|
| Construction | 7,000 | 20,000 | Falls, trenching, silica |
| Agriculture | 1,000 | 5,000 | Heat, pesticides, equipment |
| Meatpacking | 200 | 1,000 | Line speed, ergonomics |
| Warehousing | 500 | 3,000 | Heat, pace pressure |
| Healthcare | 1,500 | 5,000 | Violence, infection |

### Programmed Inspections

**Site Selection Based on**:

- Injury rate data
- Workers' compensation data
- Worker complaints
- Industry hazard profiles
- Employer violation history

## Strengthen Penalties

### Increase Civil Penalties

**Proposed Penalty Structure**:

| Violation Type | Current Max | Proposed Max | Rationale |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| Serious | $16,131 | $100,000 | Deterrence |
| Willful | $161,323 | $1,000,000 | Major deterrence |
| Repeat | $161,323 | $1,000,000 | Pattern violators |
| Worker death | $161,323 | $5,000,000 | Life value |
| Failure to abate | $16,131/day | $100,000/day | Force compliance |

### Per-Worker Penalties

For violations affecting multiple workers, assess penalties per worker affected:

| Violation | Current | Proposed |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Heat illness exposure (50 workers) | $16,131 total | $16,131 x 50 = $806,550 |
| Fall protection (20 workers) | $16,131 total | $16,131 x 20 = $322,620 |

### Criminal Penalties

**Current vs. Proposed**:

| Category | Current | Proposed |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Willful violation causing death | Misdemeanor, 6 months | Felony, 10 years |
| Repeat willful | Misdemeanor, 1 year | Felony, 20 years |
| Corporate criminal liability | Rare | Mandatory prosecution |
| Individual executive liability | Almost never | Where appropriate |

### Enterprise-Wide Enforcement

**Apply Citations Across Enterprise**:

- Violations at one site apply to all sites
- Corporate parents liable for subsidiary violations
- Franchise violations attributable to franchisors (where control exists)

## Whistleblower Protection

### Strengthen Section 11(c)

**Current Problems**:

- 30-day filing deadline
- OSHA investigates (not worker's choice)
- No private right of action
- Weak remedies

**Proposed Reforms**:

| Reform | Current | Proposed |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Filing deadline | 30 days | 180 days |
| Investigation | OSHA only | Private right of action |
| Burden of proof | Worker | Employer (once prima facie) |
| Remedies | Back pay, reinstatement | Double back pay, punitive damages |
| Preliminary reinstatement | Discretionary | Mandatory if prima facie case |
| Anti-retaliation scope | Narrow | Broad (covers internal complaints) |

### Private Right of Action

Allow workers to sue directly in federal court:

- After OSHA declines to prosecute, or
- After 180 days without resolution, or
- Immediately for injunctive relief

### Criminal Penalties for Retaliation

| Current | Proposed |
|---------|----------|
| Civil only | Criminal for egregious retaliation |
| No penalties | Up to 5 years imprisonment |
| No individual liability | Supervisor liability |
