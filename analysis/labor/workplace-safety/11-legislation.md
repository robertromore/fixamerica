# Workplace Safety: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651-678) established the framework for workplace safety regulation in America. However, the Act has significant limitations that have been exploited by employers and weakened by subsequent judicial interpretation and inadequate enforcement. Comprehensive reform requires amendments to the OSH Act, new legislation addressing specific hazards, and stronger state-level protections.

## Federal Legislation

### Protecting America's Workers Act (PAWA)

**Purpose**: Comprehensively strengthen the OSH Act to close loopholes and increase protections.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Protecting America's Workers Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that:
(1) Since the enactment of the Occupational Safety and Health Act
of 1970, more than 600,000 workers have died from workplace injuries.
(2) Each year, approximately 5,000 workers die from traumatic
injuries and tens of thousands more die from occupational diseases.
(3) Nearly 3 million workers suffer serious injuries or illnesses
annually.
(4) The maximum criminal penalty for a willful violation causing
worker death is only 6 months imprisonment, a misdemeanor.
(5) Civil penalties are insufficient to deter violations by
large corporations.
(6) Millions of public sector workers lack OSHA protection.
(7) Whistleblower protections are inadequate.

SEC. 3. COVERAGE OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES.

(a) EXTENSION OF COVERAGE.—Section 3(5) of the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 652(5)) is amended by
striking "but does not include the United States or any State
or political subdivision of a State" and inserting "and includes
the United States, any State, and any political subdivision of
a State".

(b) STATE PLAN REQUIREMENT.—Each State operating a State plan
under section 18 shall, within 2 years of enactment, amend such
plan to provide coverage for all public employees comparable to
coverage provided private sector employees.

SEC. 4. CRIMINAL PENALTIES.

(a) FELONY VIOLATION.—Section 17(e) of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 666(e)) is amended to read:

"(e) Any employer who willfully violates any standard, rule, or
order promulgated pursuant to section 6 of this Act, or of any
regulations prescribed pursuant to this Act, and that violation
causes death or serious bodily injury to any employee, shall—
(1) for a first offense, be fined under title 18, United States
Code, or imprisoned for not more than 10 years, or both; and
(2) for any subsequent offense, be fined under title 18, United
States Code, or imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.

(f) RESPONSIBLE CORPORATE OFFICERS.—Any officer or director of
an employer who had knowledge of, or reason to know of, a violation
described in subsection (e), and who failed to take reasonable
steps to prevent such violation, shall be subject to the same
penalties as the employer.

(g) SERIOUS BODILY INJURY DEFINED.—For purposes of this section,
the term 'serious bodily injury' means bodily injury which involves
a substantial risk of death, protracted unconsciousness, extreme
physical pain, protracted or obvious disfigurement, or protracted
loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or
mental faculty."

SEC. 5. CIVIL PENALTIES.

(a) PENALTY INCREASES.—Section 17 of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 666) is amended—
(1) in striking "$7,000" each place it appears and inserting
"$70,000";
(2) by striking "$70,000" each place it appears and inserting
"$700,000".

(b) ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT.—The Secretary shall annually adjust the
penalties under this section to account for inflation using the
Consumer Price Index.

(c) PER-EMPLOYEE PENALTIES.—Where a violation exposes multiple
employees to hazards, the penalty shall be assessed for each
employee exposed.

SEC. 6. WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION.

(a) FILING PERIOD.—Section 11(c) of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 660(c)) is amended by striking
"within thirty days" and inserting "within 180 days".

(b) PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.—Section 11(c) is further amended
by adding:

"(4) If the Secretary determines that there are not reasonable
grounds for the complaint, or if the Secretary has not issued
a final order within 180 days of filing, the complainant may
bring an action for relief in any appropriate United States
district court.

(5) In any action under this subsection, if the complainant
demonstrates that protected activity was a contributing factor
in the adverse action, the employer shall be liable unless it
demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would
have taken the same action in the absence of the protected
activity.

(6) REMEDIES.—Relief under this subsection shall include—
(A) reinstatement with the same seniority status;
(B) back pay with interest;
(C) compensatory damages;
(D) attorney's fees and costs; and
(E) punitive damages in cases of willful retaliation."

SEC. 7. ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT.

(a) INSPECTIONS.—The Secretary shall conduct inspections so that
each workplace subject to this Act is inspected at least once
every 5 years.

(b) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There are authorized to be
appropriated to carry out this Act $2,000,000,000 for each of
fiscal years 2026 through 2030.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 180 days after enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- Section 3 extends OSHA coverage to all public employees
- Section 4 elevates willful violations causing death to felonies
- Section 5 dramatically increases civil penalties
- Section 6 strengthens whistleblower protections
- Section 7 mandates inspection frequency and funding

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Constitutional (public employees) | Spending power; state sovereignty vs. workplace safety |
| Industry opposition | Economic analysis shows net benefits |
| Criminal enforcement resources | DOJ capacity building |

The Secretary may issue an ETS upon determining that:
(a) Employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to
substances or agents or from new hazards; and
(b) An ETS is necessary to protect employees from such danger.

2. CRITERIA FOR GRAVE DANGER
Grave danger shall be found when:
(a) A hazard poses an elevated risk of death, serious illness,
or serious physical harm;
(b) The hazard is of an emergency nature requiring immediate
action; and
(c) Existing standards or General Duty Clause enforcement are
insufficient to address the hazard.

3. EXPEDITED PROCEDURE
(a) The Secretary may issue an ETS without prior notice and
comment when grave danger exists.
(b) An ETS shall be effective upon publication in the Federal
Register.
(c) An ETS shall serve as a proposed rule for a permanent standard.

4. DURATION
An ETS shall remain in effect until a permanent standard takes
effect, but no longer than 6 months unless the Secretary
determines an extension is necessary.
```

```

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

**Federal Authority to Regulate Workplace Safety**:

| Source | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Commerce Clause | Workplace safety affects interstate commerce |
| Spending Clause | Conditions on federal funds |
| Treaty Power | ILO conventions (if ratified) |

**Public Employee Coverage**:

- Current exclusion is statutory, not constitutional
- Congress can extend coverage through amendment
- State sovereignty concerns can be addressed through spending power

### Preemption

**Federal Preemption of State Law**:

| Issue | Current Law |
|-------|-------------|
| State OSHA plans | May be more protective than federal |
| State statutes | Not preempted if more protective |
| Local ordinances | Generally not preempted |
| Workers' comp | Exclusive remedy generally preserved |

**Section 18 State Plans**:

- States may operate own OSHA programs
- Must be "at least as effective" as federal
- Subject to federal monitoring and withdrawal

### Criminal Enforcement

**Current Limitations**:

- Willful violation causing death: misdemeanor (6 months)
- Rarely prosecuted
- Burden of proof: willful conduct caused death

**Enhanced Criminal Authority (proposed)**:

- Felony status enables greater deterrence
- Corporate officer liability
- DOJ prioritization

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| "Employee" definition | Independent contractors excluded | High |
| Small employer exemptions | Some standards exempt small firms | High |
| Agricultural exemptions | Small farms exempt from OSHA | High |
| General Duty Clause limitations | Requires "recognized" hazard | Moderate |
| Citation contest delays | Employers can delay abatement | Moderate |
| Penalty settlement | Penalties routinely reduced | Moderate |
| Multi-employer worksites | Unclear responsibility | Moderate |
| Temporary worker gaps | Joint employer confusion | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Underfunding | Inadequate enforcement | Political opposition |
| Slow standard-setting | Hazards unaddressed | Industry litigation |
| Weak whistleblower protection | Retaliation chills reporting | Inadequate law |
| Public employee exclusion | Millions unprotected | Original OSH Act limitation |
| Criminal penalty weakness | No deterrence | Congressional inaction |
| State plan variation | Inconsistent protection | Federalism |
| Data limitations | True scope unknown | Underreporting |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Independent Contractor Coverage**: Amend OSH Act Section 3(6) to include all workers "economically dependent" on a business, regardless of classification.

2. **Agricultural Exemption Elimination**: Repeal small farm exemption; phase in over 3 years with technical assistance.

3. **Multi-Employer Clarification**: Codify clear joint employer responsibility with primary liability on controlling employer.

4. **Standard-Setting Acceleration**: Create presumption favoring worker protection; shift burden to industry to prove standard is not feasible.

5. **Penalty Enhancement**: Require per-employee penalties; prohibit settlement below 50% of assessed penalty.

6. **State Plan Accountability**: Mandatory benchmarks; automatic federal takeover upon failure.

7. **Data Improvement**: Electronic reporting for all employers; third-party verification; criminal penalties for underreporting.

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Employer compliance costs | Compliance assistance; phase-in periods |
| Inspector recruitment | Salary increases; training pipeline |
| Litigation delays | Expedited review procedures |
| State resistance | Federal incentives and sanctions |
| Political opposition | Coalition building; public campaigns |
