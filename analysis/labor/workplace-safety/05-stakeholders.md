# Workplace Safety: Stakeholders

## Overview

Workplace safety involves a complex web of stakeholders with often conflicting interests. Workers seek protection from harm; employers seek to minimize costs and regulatory burden; government agencies mediate between competing interests under resource constraints; and other actors shape the political and economic environment in which safety decisions are made.

## Workers
