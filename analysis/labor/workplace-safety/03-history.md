# Workplace Safety: History

## Origins

Workplace safety as a public policy concern emerged from the catastrophic conditions of early industrialization. Before the 20th century, workers had virtually no protections, and industrial accidents killed and maimed tens of thousands annually. The common law offered only limited remedies, and courts generally favored employers through doctrines like "assumption of risk" and the "fellow servant rule." The labor movement's fight for safe workplaces would span more than a century and cost many lives.

## Pre-OSHA Era

### The Gilded Age (1870-1900)

**Industrial Carnage**: The rapid industrialization of America came at an enormous human cost:

| Industry | Annual Deaths (estimated 1890s) |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| Railroads | 2,000+ |
| Coal mining | 1,500+ |
| Steel mills | Hundreds |
| Textile mills | Hundreds |
| Construction | Unknown (thousands) |

**Legal Barriers**: Workers faced near-insurmountable obstacles to compensation:

- **Assumption of risk**: Workers were deemed to have accepted dangers by taking the job
- **Fellow servant rule**: Employers not liable for injuries caused by co-workers
- **Contributory negligence**: Any worker fault barred recovery entirely

### The Triangle Shirtwaist Fire (1911)

The defining tragedy of American workplace safety occurred on March 25, 1911.

**The Disaster**:

- 146 workers killed (mostly young immigrant women)
- Locked exit doors prevented escape
- Inadequate fire escapes collapsed
- Workers jumped to their deaths to escape flames
- Fire lasted only 18 minutes

**The Response**:

- Public outrage and mass demonstrations
- New York Factory Investigating Commission established
- 36 new laws enacted in New York (1911-1914)
- Frances Perkins (future Labor Secretary) witnessed the fire
- Galvanized labor movement and progressive reformers

**Limitations**:

- Factory owners acquitted of manslaughter
- Reforms limited to New York State
- Federal action still decades away

### Progressive Era Reforms (1900-1920)

**State Workers' Compensation Laws**:

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1908 | Federal Employers' Liability Act (railroads) |
| 1911 | Wisconsin first workers' comp law |
| 1913 | California, New Jersey, others follow |
| 1920s | Most states have workers' comp |

Workers' compensation traded the right to sue for guaranteed (but limited) benefits.

**Early Federal Actions**:

- Bureau of Labor Statistics (1884): Began collecting injury data
- Bureau of Mines (1910): Mine safety after disasters
- Department of Labor created (1913)

### New Deal Era (1933-1945)

**Frances Perkins as Labor Secretary**:

- First woman in Cabinet
- Triangle fire witness
- Championed worker protections
- Limited by constitutional constraints

**Key Legislation**:

- Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act (1936): Safety standards for federal contractors
- Fair Labor Standards Act (1938): Child labor restrictions
- Mine Inspection Act (1941): Expanded mine safety

**World War II**:

- Wartime production pressures increased hazards
- Some safety standards suspended
- Women entered dangerous industrial jobs
- Post-war focus shifted to economic growth

### Post-War Period (1945-1970)

**Continued Carnage**:

| Year | Workplace Deaths |
|------|------------------|
| 1950 | ~16,000 |
| 1960 | ~14,000 |
| 1968 | ~14,300 |

Despite decades of reform, thousands continued to die annually.

**Growing Awareness**:

- Rachel Carson's *Silent Spring* (1962): Toxic chemical awareness
- Ralph Nader's *Unsafe at Any Speed* (1965): Product safety consciousness
- Mine disasters (Farmington, 1968: 78 deaths): Public outrage

**Failed Efforts**:

- Multiple federal safety bills introduced (1960s)
- Business opposition blocked legislation
- Johnson administration proposed but didn't pass OSHA

## The OSH Act (1970)

### Political Context

The convergence of factors enabled passage:

- High-profile industrial disasters
- Growing environmental movement
- Strong labor movement (peak union density)
- Nixon seeking labor support
- Bipartisan agreement on need for action

### The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970

**Key Provisions**:

| Provision | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| General Duty Clause | Employers must provide workplace "free from recognized hazards" |
| Specific Standards | OSHA authorized to issue detailed regulations |
| Inspection Authority | OSHA can inspect workplaces without advance notice |
| Citations and Penalties | Civil and criminal enforcement |
| NIOSH | Research agency to support standard-setting |
| State Plans | States can run their own programs |

**Signed**: December 29, 1970 (effective April 28, 1971)

**Coverage**: ~60 million workers initially (now 130+ million)

### Early Implementation (1971-1980)

**Initial Challenges**:

- Adopted thousands of existing industry standards quickly
- Many standards outdated or trivial
- Business complained of overregulation
- Limited enforcement capacity

**Notable Actions**:

- Cotton dust standard (1978): Major rulemaking for brown lung disease
- Benzene standard litigation: Led to Supreme Court limits on OSHA
- Asbestos regulation: Early toxic substance standards

**Supreme Court Decisions**:

| Case | Year | Holding |
|------|------|---------|
| *Marshall v. Barlow's* | 1978 | Warrants required for nonconsent inspections |
| *Industrial Union v. API* (Benzene) | 1980 | OSHA must show "significant risk" |
| *American Textile v. Donovan* | 1981 | Cost-benefit analysis not required |

## Key Turning Points

### Reagan Administration Deregulation (1981-1989)

The Reagan administration fundamentally shifted OSHA's approach:

**Policy Changes**:

- Voluntary compliance emphasized over enforcement
- Inspections reduced dramatically
- Standards rolled back or delayed
- Cooperative programs prioritized

**Budget and Staffing Cuts**:

| Metric | 1980 | 1989 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Budget (real dollars) | $257M | $203M | -21% |
| Inspectors | 1,469 | 1,044 | -29% |
| Inspections | 63,363 | 44,282 | -30% |

**Thorne Auchter Era**:

- OSHA Assistant Secretary (1981-1984)
- Construction industry background
- Closed cancer policy office
- Delayed asbestos standards
- Reduced penalty assessments

### Clinton Administration (1993-2001)

**Attempted Revival**:

- Joe Dear as Assistant Secretary
- Increased enforcement
- Ergonomics standard development (10+ years)

**Ergonomics Standard**:

- Issued November 2000 (final days)
- Covered repetitive stress injuries
- Business estimated $4.5 billion cost
- Immediately targeted for repeal

### George W. Bush Administration (2001-2009)

**Congressional Review Act Repeal**:

- Ergonomics standard repealed (March 2001)
- First major CRA repeal
- Precedent for future regulatory rollbacks

**Enforcement Decline**:

- Focus on "cooperative" programs
- Penalty reductions
- Standard-setting stalled
- VPP (Voluntary Protection Programs) expanded

### Obama Administration (2009-2017)

**Partial Recovery**:

- David Michaels as Assistant Secretary (2009-2017)
- Renewed enforcement emphasis
- Silica standard (2016)
- Injury reporting rule expanded
- Heat illness focus (never completed)

**Silica Standard**:

- Took 45+ years to update
- Industry fought vigorously
- Reduced permissible exposure level by 50%
- Estimated to prevent 600+ deaths/year

### Trump Administration (2017-2021)

**Deregulatory Agenda**:

- Two-for-one rule (eliminate two regulations for each new one)
- Enforcement emphasis reduced
- COVID-19 response failures
- No permanent COVID standard

**COVID-19 Failures**:

- No emergency temporary standard for 17 months
- Limited inspections
- Minimal citations for COVID deaths
- Meatpacking plants allowed to operate despite outbreaks

### Biden Administration (2021-2025)

**Enforcement Emphasis**:

- Doug Parker as Assistant Secretary
- Increased inspector hiring
- Heat rulemaking initiated
- Warehouse safety focus (Amazon)
- Penalty increases

**Ongoing Challenges**:

- Inspector shortages persist
- Heat standard not finalized
- No permanent infectious disease standard
- Gig economy gaps unaddressed

## Lessons from the Past

### What History Teaches

1. **Disasters Drive Reform**: Major legislation follows catastrophic events (Triangle, mine disasters, COVID)

2. **Business Resistance is Constant**: Every major standard faces industry opposition claiming economic ruin

3. **Gains Are Reversible**: Progress can be undone quickly through budget cuts, deregulation, and weak enforcement

4. **Enforcement Requires Resources**: Standards without inspectors are meaningless

5. **Vulnerable Workers Bear the Burden**: Immigrants, people of color, and temporary workers have always faced the worst conditions

6. **Criminal Enforcement Never Materialized**: Despite 50+ years, criminal prosecution remains rare

### Recurring Patterns

| Pattern | Historical Examples |
|---------|---------------------|
| "Wait for bodies" approach | Standards only after disasters |
| Cost-benefit paralysis | Decades to issue standards |
| Regulatory capture | Industry insiders lead OSHA |
| Voluntary compliance myth | Never produces lasting improvement |
| Underfunding | Inspectors always insufficient |
