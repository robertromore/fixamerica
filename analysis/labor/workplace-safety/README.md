# Workplace Safety: Overview

Every year, more than 5,000 American workers die on the job and nearly 3 million suffer serious injuries or illnesses. These are not accidents but preventable tragedies resulting from systemic failures in workplace safety enforcement, inadequate standards, and employer prioritization of profits over worker protection. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), created in 1970 to ensure safe working conditions, has been systematically weakened through understaffing, underfunding, and regulatory capture. With fewer than 2,000 federal inspectors responsible for 8 million workplaces, the average employer can expect an OSHA inspection once every 165 years.
