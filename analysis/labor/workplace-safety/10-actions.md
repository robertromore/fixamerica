# Workplace Safety: What You Can Do

## Overview

Workers are not powerless in the face of workplace hazards. Federal law provides important rights, though they are often underenforced. Collective action through unions and community organizations can amplify individual voices. This guide provides practical steps workers can take to protect themselves and improve safety for all workers.

## Know Your Rights

### Fundamental OSHA Rights

Every worker covered by OSHA has the right to:

| Right | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Safe workplace | Free from recognized hazards |
| Information | Know about hazards and protections |
| Training | Receive training on hazards in your language |
| Records | See injury/illness logs and exposure records |
| Report hazards | File complaints without retaliation |
| Participate in inspections | Talk to inspectors, accompany on walkaround |
| Protection from retaliation | Cannot be fired for exercising rights |

### What Employers Must Provide

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Safety training | Job-specific hazard training |
| Personal protective equipment | At no cost to worker |
| Medical records | Access to your exposure records |
| Injury logs | OSHA 300 log available for review |
| Hazard communication | Safety data sheets for chemicals |

### Your Right to Refuse Dangerous Work

You can refuse to work if:

- You have a reasonable belief of serious injury or death
- You have asked the employer to fix the hazard
- There is not enough time to get OSHA inspection
- You have no other reasonable choice

**Important**: Document your refusal and reasons in writing.

## Report Hazards

### Filing an OSHA Complaint

**Step 1: Document the Hazard**

**Step 3: Choose Complaint Type**

| Type | Features |
|------|----------|
| Formal (signed) | Requires on-site inspection |

**Recommendation**: File formal, signed complaints when possible.

**Step 4: Request Confidentiality**

- Your name can be kept confidential from employer
- Check box on complaint form
- Still provide name to OSHA

### What Happens After You File

### Tips for Effective Complaints

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Be specific about hazards | Make vague allegations |
| Include locations and dates | Rely on general concerns |
| Identify workers at risk | Complain about non-safety issues |
| Follow up with OSHA | Assume one call is enough |
| Keep copies | Throw away documentation |
