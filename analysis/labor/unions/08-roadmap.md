# Labor Unions: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Rebuilding worker power in America requires coordinated action across multiple fronts over an extended period. This roadmap sequences reforms from immediately achievable to transformational, while recognizing that opportunities may arise out of sequence.

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Years 1-2)

### Executive Action

**Achievable Without Congress**

| Action | Mechanism | Timeline |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Federal contractor standards | Executive order | Immediate |
| Project labor agreements | Agency policy | Months 1-3 |
| NLRB appointments | Senate confirmation | Ongoing |
| Task force implementation | Inter-agency | Months 1-6 |
| Procurement debarment | Agency enforcement | Months 3-6 |

**Federal Contractor Requirements**

1. $15+ minimum wage (implemented)
2. Paid leave requirements
3. Union neutrality clauses
4. Labor law compliance certification
5. Debarment for violators

**NLRB Priorities**

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Rule making | Faster elections, notice requirements |
| Enforcement | Prioritize 10(j) injunctions |
| Guidance | Clarify worker rights |
| Staffing | Request appropriations increase |

### Congressional Groundwork

**Building Support for PRO Act**

| Task | Actions |
|------|---------|
| Whip count | Identify movable senators |
| Public pressure | Targeted campaigns in swing states |
| Business voices | Recruit supportive business leaders |
| State pressure | State AFL-CIOs lobby home senators |

**Appropriations**

| Agency | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| NLRB | $299M | $400M |
| DOL Wage & Hour | Limited | Increased |
| OSHA | Limited | Increased |

### State-Level Wins

**Priority States (Democratic Control)**

| State | Priority Legislation |
|-------|---------------------|
| California | Warehouse worker protections, sectoral pilot |
| New York | Card check for certain sectors |
| Illinois | Labor peace agreements |
| Washington | Worker board representation |
| Minnesota | Captive audience ban (achieved), expand |
| Michigan | Repeal right-to-work (achieved), next steps |

**Defensive Priorities**

| State | Threat | Defense |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Swing states | Right-to-work attempts | Electoral mobilization |
| Blue states | Conservative court challenges | Legal defense |

### Organizing Momentum

**Build on Current Wave**

| Campaign | Goal |
|----------|------|
| Amazon | Expand beyond ALU, coordinate campaigns |
| Starbucks | Win first contracts, expand |
| Tech | Build on initial wins |
| Healthcare | Major campaign in home care |

**Resource Allocation**

| Priority | Investment |
|----------|------------|
| Organizing staff | Major increase |

## Phase 2: Legislative Breakthrough (Years 2-4)

### Federal Reform

**Scenario A: Filibuster Reform/Elimination**

If 50+ senators support filibuster reform for labor legislation:

| Step | Timeline |
|------|----------|
| Filibuster carve-out | Year 2 |
| PRO Act passage | Months after |
| Implementation | 1-2 years |

**Scenario B: Reconciliation**

Some provisions might pass through budget reconciliation:

| Provision | Reconciliation Potential |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Penalties | Yes (revenue) |
| IRS enforcement | Yes (spending) |
| NLRB funding | Yes (spending) |
| Core labor law changes | No |

**Scenario C: Persistent Gridlock**

If federal legislation blocked:

| Alternative | Approach |
|-------------|----------|
| State action | Comprehensive state reforms |
| Executive maximalism | Push executive authority limits |
| Organizing surge | Build power without law change |
| Electoral focus | Change Senate composition |

### State Strategy

**Model Legislation Package**

| Bill | Description |
|------|-------------|
| State PRO Act | Mirror federal provisions where allowed |
| Captive audience ban | Prohibit mandatory meetings |

| Misclassification enforcement | Strong ABC test |

**Priority State Targets**

| Year | Target States |
|------|---------------|
| 2 | CO, NM, VA, NV |
| 3 | PA, WI, MI (expand) |
| 4 | AZ, GA (if Democratic gains) |

### Sectoral Bargaining Pilots

**Initial Sectors**

| Sector | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Fast food | Already has wage boards in some states |
| Home care | Medicaid funding provides leverage |
| Hotel/hospitality | Geographic concentration |
| Janitorial | Successful organizing history |

**Pilot Structure**

1. State establishes sectoral bargaining framework
2. Union(s) designated as worker representatives
3. Employer association formed or designated
4. Negotiations produce sector agreement
5. Agreement extended to all employers
6. Evaluation and expansion

## Phase 3: Expansion and Consolidation (Years 4-7)

### Federal Implementation

**If PRO Act Passes**

| Task | Timeline |
|------|----------|
| NLRB rulemaking | 6-12 months |

**Expected Outcomes**

| Metric | Current | Year 5 Target | Year 10 Target |
|--------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Union density (overall) | 10% | 13% | 18% |
| Private sector density | 6% | 9% | 14% |
| New organizing wins | 1,400/year | 5,000/year | 10,000/year |

### State Expansion

## Dependencies and Sequencing

### Critical Path

```text
Executive action (immediate)
        |
        v
State-level wins (Years 1-3)
        |
        v
Electoral gains (maintain/expand)
        |
        v
Federal reform (when possible)
        |
        v
Sectoral expansion (build on wins)
        |
        v
Systemic change (sustained effort)
```

### Key Dependencies

| Action | Depends On |
|--------|------------|
| PRO Act passage | Senate composition, filibuster |
| NLRB effectiveness | Appointments, funding |
| State reform | State political control |
| Organizing success | Legal environment, resources |
| Sectoral bargaining | State action first, then federal |

## Risk Assessment

### Major Risks

| Movement division | Low-Medium | Unity building |

### Scenario Planning

**Best Case**

- PRO Act passes in Years 2-3

- Significant state progress
- Gradual union growth
- Sectoral bargaining in 5+ states by Year 10

**Worst Case**
