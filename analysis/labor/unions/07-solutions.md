# Labor Unions: Solutions

## Overview

Rebuilding worker power requires a comprehensive strategy addressing legal barriers, employer opposition, and changing economic structures. Solutions range from modest reforms within the current framework to fundamental restructuring of labor relations.

## Legal Reform

### The PRO Act (Protecting the Right to Organize Act)

**Current Status**: Passed House (2021), blocked in Senate by filibuster

**Key Provisions**

| Provision | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Ban captive audience meetings | End mandatory anti-union sessions |
| Card check option | Majority sign-up = recognition |
| First contract arbitration | Prevent endless delays |
| Ban permanent striker replacement | Restore right to strike |
| Penalties for violations | Personal liability for executives |
| Override right-to-work | Federal floor for union security |
| Joint employer clarity | Hold parent companies accountable |
| Independent contractor limits | ABC test to prevent misclassification |
| Ban class action waivers | Restore collective legal action |

**Why It Matters**

The PRO Act would be the most significant pro-worker labor law reform since the Wagner Act. It directly addresses the root causes of union decline:

| Problem | PRO Act Solution |
|---------|------------------|
| Employer coercion | Ban captive audience, increase penalties |
| Slow elections | Card check bypasses delays |
| First contract failures | Mandatory arbitration |
| Strike weakness | Ban permanent replacements |
| Right-to-work | Federal override |
| Misclassification | ABC test |

**Estimated Impact**

- Could increase union membership by 25-50%
- Would raise wages for 10+ million workers
- Would reduce inequality measurably

### Card Check Recognition

**Current Process**

1. Workers sign authorization cards
2. Union files petition with NLRB
3. Employer can challenge (delays)
4. NLRB conducts secret ballot election
5. Employer campaigns against union
6. If union wins, bargaining begins

**Card Check Process**

1. Workers sign authorization cards
2. When majority signs, union is recognized
3. Bargaining begins

**Arguments For**

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Faster recognition | Weeks vs. months/years |
| Less employer interference | No campaign period |
| Worker preference | Workers chose to sign |
| International norm | Most countries use majority sign-up |

**Arguments Against**

| Argument | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Secret ballot is democratic | Cards are also voluntary choice |
| Peer pressure concern | Employer pressure in elections is greater |
| Process change | Process has always evolved |

### First Contract Arbitration

**The Problem**

- 37% of new unions never get a first contract
- Median time to first contract: 465 days
- Employers delay indefinitely with no penalty

**The Solution**

If parties cannot reach agreement within set time (e.g., 120 days), either party can request:

1. Mediation
2. If mediation fails, binding arbitration
3. Arbitrator imposes contract terms

**How It Works in Canada**

| Province | First Contract Success |
|----------|----------------------|
| British Columbia | 92% within 2 years |
| Ontario | 89% within 2 years |
| U.S. (without arbitration) | 63% within 2 years |

### Meaningful Penalties

**Current vs. Proposed Penalties**

| Violation | Current Penalty | Proposed Penalty |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Illegal firing | Back pay minus earnings | Back pay + liquidated damages + civil penalty |
| Threats/coercion | Cease and desist | $50,000+ per violation |
| Pattern violations | Repeated C&D | Personal liability for executives |
| Repeat offenders | Same | Debarment from federal contracts |

**Civil Penalties in PRO Act**

- Up to $50,000 per violation
- Up to $100,000 for repeat violations
- Personal liability for directors and officers
- These penalties would actually deter violations

### Ban on Captive Audience Meetings

**Current Law**

- Employers can require attendance at anti-union meetings
- Workers cannot hold equivalent meetings
- Fundamental asymmetry

**Proposed Change**

- Employers cannot require attendance at meetings about union organizing
- Workers who attend must be told attendance is voluntary
- Workers can leave at any time without consequence

**State Action**

Several states have already banned captive audience meetings:

| State | Year | Law |
|-------|------|-----|
| Oregon | 2010 | First state to ban |
| Connecticut | 2022 | Worker Freedom Act |
| Minnesota | 2023 | Captive audience ban |
| New York | 2023 | Captive audience ban |

## Sectoral Bargaining

### The Concept

Instead of bargaining workplace by workplace, unions negotiate wages and conditions for entire industries or sectors.

**Current Model vs. Sectoral Model**

| Feature | Current (Enterprise) | Sectoral |
|---------|---------------------|----------|
| Bargaining unit | Single workplace | Entire industry |
| Coverage | Only union members | All workers in sector |
| Negotiations | With single employer | With employer associations |
| Wage competition | Employers compete on wages | Competition on other factors |
| Organizing incentive | Employers fight unions | Less individual resistance |

### International Models

**Nordic Countries (Denmark, Sweden)**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Coverage | 80-90% of workers |
| Union density | 50-67% |
| Bargaining level | National and sectoral |
| Wage setting | Negotiated minimums by sector |
| Enforcement | Strong state support |

**Germany**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Works councils | Worker representation at each firm |
| Codetermination | Workers on corporate boards |
| Sectoral agreements | Industry-wide contracts |
| Coverage | 54% of workers |
| Extension mechanisms | Agreements extended to non-union firms |

**Australia**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Fair Work Commission | Sets industry awards |
| Minimum conditions | By industry |
| Enterprise bargaining | On top of awards |
| Coverage | Near-universal for minimums |

### Sectoral Bargaining for America

**Proposed Structure**

| Level | Function |
|-------|----------|
| National | Basic standards, portability |
| Sectoral | Industry-specific wages, conditions |
| Enterprise | Supplemental bargaining |

**Implementation**

1. **Industry identification**: Define sectors (hospitality, retail, healthcare, etc.)
2. **Representative bodies**: Unions represent workers; employer associations represent employers
3. **Bargaining process**: Negotiate sector-wide agreements
4. **Extension**: Apply agreements to all workers in sector
5. **Enforcement**: Government ensures compliance

**Potential Benefits**

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Higher coverage | All workers benefit, not just union members |
| Less employer resistance | No competitive advantage to fighting unions |
| Simpler organizing | Don't need to win each workplace |
| Reduced inequality | Wage floors across industries |
| Better for small business | Compete on quality, not worker exploitation |

### Wage Boards

**A Step Toward Sectoral Bargaining**

Wage boards are tripartite bodies (workers, employers, government) that set minimum standards for specific industries.

**Existing Examples**

| Jurisdiction | Sector | Outcome |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| New York | Fast food | $15 minimum wage (first in U.S.) |
| California | Fast food | $20 minimum wage (2024) |
| Seattle | Hotel | $20.76 minimum wage |
| California | Healthcare | $25 minimum wage (phased in) |

**Expansion Potential**

Wage boards could be established for:

- Warehouse/logistics
- Home care
- Agriculture
- Janitorial
- Retail

## Public Policy Support

### Government as Model Employer

**Federal Workforce**

| Policy | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Maintain federal union rights | Set example |
| Project labor agreements | Union construction for federal projects |
| Federal contractor standards | Require good labor practices |
| Debarment for violators | Bar repeat labor law violators |

**Biden Administration Actions**

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Task Force on Worker Organizing | Completed report |
| NLRB appointees | Pro-worker majority |
| Executive order on contractor wages | $15 minimum |
| Support for organizing | Public statements |

### Procurement Standards

**Federal Contractor Requirements**

| Requirement | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Living wage | $15+ for all contractor workers |
| Paid leave | Minimum sick/family leave |
| Union neutrality | Cannot oppose organizing |
| Debarment | For labor law violations |

**State/Local Procurement**

Similar standards at state and local level can extend coverage beyond federal contracts.

### Labor Law Enforcement

**NLRB Funding**

| Metric | 2010 | 2023 | Need |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Staff | 1,650 | 1,150 | 2,000+ |
| Budget | $283M | $299M | $500M+ |
| Case backlog | Manageable | Growing | Reduced |

Adequate funding would enable:

- Faster elections
- More investigators
- Better enforcement
- Deterrent effect

### Worker Misclassification

**The Problem**

- 10-30% of workers misclassified as independent contractors
- Lose NLRA rights, benefits, wage/hour protections
- Costs government $billions in lost taxes

**Solutions**

| Solution | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| ABC test | Presume employee unless clearly independent |
| Joint employer rules | Hold franchisors, lead contractors liable |
| Enhanced enforcement | More audits, investigations |
| Penalties | Meaningful fines for misclassification |

## Union Strategies

### Comprehensive Campaigns

**Elements of Successful Organizing**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Worker-led | Organizers from inside workforce |
| High participation | Supermajority support before filing |
| Community support | Coalition with community allies |
| Corporate campaign | Pressure beyond workplace |
| Media strategy | Public narrative |
| Political support | Elected officials involved |

**Examples**

- Justice for Janitors (SEIU)
- Fight for $15 (SEIU)
- Amazon Labor Union (independent)

### New Organizing Models

**Worker-to-Worker Digital Organizing**

| Tactic | Use |
|--------|-----|
| Social media | Share experiences, build solidarity |
| Online petitions | Demonstrate support |
| Slack/Discord | Coordinate away from employer surveillance |
| TikTok | Reach younger workers |

**Minority Unions**

- Organize without majority recognition
- Build power through collective action
- Create pressure for eventual recognition
- Example: Alphabet Workers Union (Google)

### Member Engagement

**Strategies**

| Strategy | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Increased participation | Members involved in decisions |
| Bargaining for common good | Broader community issues |
| Leadership development | Build next generation |
| Political education | Connect workplace to politics |

## State and Local Action

### State Labor Law Reform

**Potential State Actions**

| Action | States That Have Done It |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Public sector bargaining rights | 30+ states |
| Captive audience bans | OR, CT, MN, NY |
| Domestic worker protections | NY, CA, IL, HI |
| Gig worker standards | CA (AB5, modified by Prop 22) |
| Card check for public sector | Several states |

### Local Ordinances

**Municipal Labor Standards**

| Standard | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Living wage | 100+ cities |
| Scheduling | San Francisco, Seattle, NYC |
| Domestic worker rights | Seattle, Philadelphia |
| Hotel worker protections | Los Angeles, Long Beach |

### Ballot Initiatives

**Direct Democracy**

| Initiative | Result |
|------------|--------|
| Minimum wage increases | Passed in red states (FL, MO, NE) |
| Paid leave | Passed in multiple states |
| Gig worker classification | Mixed (CA Prop 22) |

Ballot initiatives bypass legislative gridlock and generally succeed on labor issues.

## Constitutional Approaches

### First Amendment Concerns

**Current Doctrine**

- *Citizens United*: Corporate political speech protected
- *Janus*: Public sector fees are compelled speech

**Reform Approaches**

| Approach | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| Overturn *Janus* | New Court composition |
| Constitutional amendment | Overturn *Citizens United* |
| Legislative workaround | Statutory changes within current doctrine |

### Positive Rights

**Constitutional Amendments**

Some advocates propose constitutional amendments establishing:

- Right to organize
- Right to collective bargaining
- Right to strike

These would require supermajority support and are long-term goals.
