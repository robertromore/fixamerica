# Labor Unions: History

## Origins of the American Labor Movement

### Early Labor Organization (1790s-1860s)

The first American labor organizations emerged among skilled craftsmen:

- **1790s**: First craft unions (shoemakers, printers, carpenters)
- **1806**: *Commonwealth v. Pullis* - Philadelphia shoemakers convicted of criminal conspiracy for striking
- **1842**: *Commonwealth v. Hunt* - Massachusetts court rules unions are legal organizations
- **1860s**: National unions form (Iron Molders, Machinists)

### The Gilded Age (1870-1900)

Rapid industrialization created massive factories and intense labor conflict:

**Major Organizations**

| Organization | Founded | Peak Membership | Focus |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Knights of Labor | 1869 | 800,000 (1886) | All workers, industrial |
| American Federation of Labor | 1886 | 2 million (1904) | Skilled craft workers |

**Major Conflicts**

| Event | Year | Outcome |
|-------|------|---------|
| Great Railroad Strike | 1877 | Federal troops deployed; strikers killed |
| Haymarket Affair | 1886 | Labor leaders executed; eight-hour movement set back |
| Homestead Strike | 1892 | Pinkerton guards kill workers; union crushed |
| Pullman Strike | 1894 | Federal injunction; Eugene Debs jailed |

This era established the pattern of employer resistance backed by government force.

### Progressive Era (1900-1920)

**Growth and Recognition**

- AFL membership grew from 500,000 (1898) to 4 million (1920)
- Some industries achieved recognition (coal, railroads, construction)
- Triangle Shirtwaist Fire (1911) spurred workplace safety laws

**Legal Developments**

- **Clayton Act (1914)**: Declared labor is "not a commodity," attempted to limit injunctions against unions
- Courts interpreted it narrowly, limiting effectiveness

**World War I**

- Government needed labor peace for war production
- War Labor Board recognized unions, prohibited strikes
- Union membership surged
- Gains largely reversed after war ended

### The 1920s: Decline

**"American Plan" Era**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Employer "open shop" campaigns | Union membership fell |
| Welfare capitalism | Company benefits as alternative to unions |
| Red Scare | Union leaders arrested, deported |
| Court injunctions | Strikes routinely enjoined |
| AFL conservatism | Failed to organize mass production industries |

Union membership fell from 5 million (1920) to 3.4 million (1929).

## The New Deal Revolution (1930s-1940s)

### The Great Depression and Labor

The Depression created conditions for labor organizing:

- Mass unemployment discredited business leadership
- Workers had nothing to lose
- FDR's election signaled government support

### National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act, 1935)

**Key Provisions**

| Provision | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Section 7 | Workers have right to organize and bargain collectively |
| Section 8 | Employer unfair labor practices defined |
| NLRB | Created to conduct elections, enforce law |
| Majority rule | Union represents all workers if majority votes for it |

**Protected Activities**

- Forming or joining unions
- Collective bargaining
- Striking
- Other concerted activity

**Prohibited Employer Conduct**

- Interfering with organizing
- Dominating or funding company unions
- Discriminating against union supporters
- Refusing to bargain with certified unions

### The CIO and Industrial Unionism

The Congress of Industrial Organizations (split from AFL, 1935) organized mass production industries:

**Major CIO Victories**

| Campaign | Year | Union | Workers Organized |
|----------|------|-------|-------------------|
| General Motors sit-down strike | 1936-37 | UAW | 400,000 |
| U.S. Steel recognition | 1937 | USWA | 500,000 |
| Ford recognition | 1941 | UAW | 80,000 |
| Meatpacking | 1937-43 | PWOC | 100,000+ |

### Union Growth

| Year | Union Members | Density |
|------|---------------|---------|
| 1930 | 3.4 million | 11.6% |
| 1935 | 3.6 million | 13.2% |
| 1940 | 8.7 million | 26.9% |
| 1945 | 14.3 million | 35.5% |

## The Taft-Hartley Era (1947-1960s)

### Taft-Hartley Act (1947)

Passed over President Truman's veto by a Republican Congress, Taft-Hartley significantly weakened union power:

**Key Restrictions**

| Provision | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Secondary boycotts banned | Unions can't pressure neutral employers |
| Closed shop banned | Can't require union membership before hiring |
| Right-to-work authorized | States can ban union security agreements |
| Communist affidavits required | Union officers must swear non-membership |
| Employer "free speech" | Employers can campaign against unions |
| 80-day cooling off period | President can halt "national emergency" strikes |
| Unfair labor practices for unions | New restrictions on union tactics |

**Long-term Effects**

- Right-to-work laws spread through South
- Employer anti-union campaigns legitimized
- Radical labor leaders purged
- Organizing in hostile regions much harder

### McCarthyism and Union Purges

The CIO expelled eleven unions accused of Communist leadership (1949-50), weakening the labor movement:

- Lost most radical organizers
- Abandoned organizing in South
- Labor movement became more conservative
- Civil rights-labor alliance weakened

### AFL-CIO Merger (1955)

The AFL and CIO merged in 1955, creating a unified labor federation:

- Combined membership: 15 million
- George Meany as first president
- Hoped to end jurisdictional disputes
- But also meant less organizing competition

### Peak Union Density

**The High Point (1954)**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Union members | 17.5 million |
| Union density | 35% |
| Private sector density | ~35% |
| Public sector | Largely unorganized |

This represented the peak of American union power. Workers in steel, auto, rubber, electrical, meatpacking, trucking, and construction had strong unions. The "Treaty of Detroit" (1950) - a five-year UAW-GM contract - established the model of regular wage increases, health benefits, and pensions.

## Public Sector Organizing (1960s-1970s)

### Executive Order 10988 (1962)

President Kennedy's order granted federal workers limited bargaining rights:

- Could organize and bargain
- No right to strike
- No union security
- Advisory arbitration only

### State and Local Organizing

Public sector unions exploded in the 1960s-70s:

| Union | Founded | Membership Growth |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| AFSCME | 1932 | 100,000 (1961) to 1 million (1978) |
| AFT | 1916 | 60,000 (1960) to 500,000 (1978) |
| NEA | 1857 | Began collective bargaining 1960s |

**Strikes and Militancy**

- 1968: Memphis sanitation strike (MLK assassination)
- 1970s: Teachers' strikes nationwide
- Public sector became increasingly unionized as private sector declined

## The Decline Begins (1970s-1980s)

### Economic Changes

| Factor | Effect on Unions |
|--------|------------------|
| Oil shocks, stagflation | Economic instability weakened bargaining |
| Deindustrialization | Manufacturing jobs moved South, overseas |
| Service sector growth | Harder to organize, more part-time |
| Deregulation | Trucking, airlines lost union density |

### Legal Environment

- Courts narrowed NLRA interpretations
- NLRB enforcement weakened
- Employer tactics became more sophisticated
- Penalty-to-benefit ratio encouraged violations

### The PATCO Strike (1981)

**Timeline**

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| August 3, 1981 | 13,000 air traffic controllers strike |
| August 5, 1981 | Reagan fires all strikers |
| October 1981 | PATCO decertified |

**Significance**

The PATCO firing signaled that employers could permanently replace strikers without serious consequences. Strike activity collapsed:

| Period | Annual Major Work Stoppages |
|--------|----------------------------|
| 1947-1979 (average) | 303 |
| 1980s (average) | 83 |
| 2000s (average) | 20 |
| 2010s (average) | 15 |

### Accelerating Decline

| Year | Private Sector Union Rate |
|------|---------------------------|
| 1980 | 20.1% |
| 1985 | 14.3% |
| 1990 | 11.9% |
| 1995 | 10.3% |
| 2000 | 9.0% |

## Modern Era (1990s-Present)

### The Sweeney Era (1995-2009)

John Sweeney won AFL-CIO presidency promising renewed organizing:

- "Organize or die" rhetoric
- Organizing Institute created
- Some unions (SEIU, UNITE HERE) devoted more resources to organizing
- But overall decline continued

### Change to Win (2005)

Several large unions left AFL-CIO to form Change to Win federation:

| Union | Members | Focus |
|-------|---------|-------|
| SEIU | 1.8 million | Healthcare, janitors, public sector |
| Teamsters | 1.4 million | Trucking, warehousing |
| UFCW | 1.3 million | Retail, food processing |
| UNITE HERE | 275,000 | Hotels, food service |
| UFW | 27,000 | Farm workers |

Split weakened labor movement; limited organizing gains achieved.

### Employee Free Choice Act (2009)

Democrats controlled Congress and presidency, but EFCA failed:

**Proposed Changes**

- Card check recognition (majority signing cards = union)
- First contract arbitration
- Increased penalties for violations

**Outcome**

- Filibustered in Senate
- Moderate Democrats opposed
- Never reached floor vote
- Major missed opportunity

### Janus v. AFSCME (2018)

Supreme Court ruled public sector workers cannot be required to pay union fees:

**Impact**

- Overturned 40 years of precedent (*Abood v. Detroit Board of Education*, 1977)
- Free rider problem in public sector
- Some unions lost 10-20% of fee payers
- But most public sector unions retained membership through internal organizing

### New Organizing Wave (2021-Present)

A surge of organizing activity, especially among young workers:

**Key Developments**

| Event | Date | Significance |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Amazon (ALU) victory | April 2022 | First Amazon union |
| Starbucks campaign begins | December 2021 | 400+ stores organized |
| Apple Store vote | June 2022 | First Apple retail union |
| Railroad strike threat | 2022 | Near-strike; Congress intervened |

**Drivers of New Activity**

- COVID-19 exposed essential worker vulnerability
- Tight labor market increased worker leverage
- Social media enabled new organizing tactics
- Young workers more pro-union

## Timeline of Key Events

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1935 | Wagner Act passed |
| 1936-37 | GM sit-down strike; CIO organizing wave |
| 1947 | Taft-Hartley Act passed |
| 1954 | Peak union density (35%) |
| 1955 | AFL-CIO merger |
| 1962 | Kennedy executive order on federal unions |
| 1981 | PATCO strike; Reagan fires strikers |
| 1995 | Sweeney wins AFL-CIO presidency |
| 2005 | Change to Win split |
| 2009 | Employee Free Choice Act fails |
| 2018 | Janus v. AFSCME decided |
| 2021-22 | Amazon, Starbucks organizing wave |

## Lessons from History

### What Enabled Union Growth

1. **Legal framework**: Wagner Act created enforceable rights
2. **Worker militancy**: Sit-down strikes, mass picketing
3. **Economic conditions**: Depression created openings
4. **Political support**: New Deal coalition backed labor
5. **Organizing strategy**: CIO organized industrially, across skill levels

### What Caused Decline

1. **Legal restrictions**: Taft-Hartley weakened organizing tools
2. **Employer opposition**: Sophisticated anti-union campaigns
3. **Economic restructuring**: Manufacturing decline, service growth
4. **Political abandonment**: Both parties moved right on labor
5. **Union complacency**: Insufficient organizing investment

### The Central Paradox

The Wagner Act created worker rights that built a powerful labor movement. But that movement never secured the political power to protect those rights from erosion. Taft-Hartley, court decisions, and hostile enforcement gradually undermined the law, while the broader political system became increasingly captured by business interests.
