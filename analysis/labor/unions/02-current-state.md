# Labor Unions: Current State

## The Problem Today

### National Union Membership

**Overall Union Membership (2023)**

| Metric | Number/Rate |
|--------|-------------|
| Total union members | 14.4 million |
| Union membership rate | 10.0% |
| Workers covered by union contracts | 11.2% |
| Peak membership (1954) | 35% |
| Decline from peak | -25 percentage points |

**Sector Breakdown**

| Sector | Membership Rate | Members |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| Public sector | 32.5% | 7.1 million |
| Private sector | 6.0% | 7.3 million |
| Private sector (1983) | 16.8% | - |
| Private sector decline | -10.8 pp | - |

The private sector rate of 6% is the lowest recorded since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking in 1983. At current trends, private sector unionization could fall below 5% within a decade.

### Union Density by Industry

**Highest Union Density Industries (2023)**

| Industry | Union Rate |
|----------|------------|
| Utilities | 19.6% |
| Transportation and warehousing | 15.2% |
| Construction | 12.3% |
| Education and health services | 11.0% |
| Manufacturing | 8.2% |
| Information | 7.9% |

**Lowest Union Density Industries**

| Industry | Union Rate |
|----------|------------|
| Agriculture | 1.1% |
| Finance | 1.2% |
| Professional and business services | 1.5% |
| Retail trade | 4.4% |
| Leisure and hospitality | 4.5% |

The industries with the lowest unionization are among the fastest-growing employment sectors, explaining much of the aggregate decline.

### Public Sector Union Membership

**By Level of Government**

| Level | Union Rate |
|-------|------------|
| Federal | 25.0% |
| State | 29.4% |
| Local | 39.4% |

**By Occupation (Public Sector)**

| Occupation | Union Rate |
|------------|------------|
| Teachers | 33.1% |
| Protective services (police, fire) | 34.7% |
| Healthcare practitioners | 16.9% |
| Office and administrative | 21.4% |

Public sector unions have maintained higher density due to more favorable legal frameworks in many states, but face significant threats from right-to-work laws and Supreme Court decisions like *Janus v. AFSCME* (2018).

### Geographic Variation

**Union Membership by State (2023)**

| State | Union Rate | State | Union Rate |
|-------|------------|-------|------------|
| Hawaii | 21.9% | South Carolina | 1.7% |
| New York | 20.5% | North Carolina | 2.4% |
| Washington | 17.0% | Utah | 3.3% |
| California | 15.9% | Texas | 3.8% |
| Alaska | 15.8% | Georgia | 4.0% |
| New Jersey | 14.4% | Virginia | 4.1% |
| Rhode Island | 14.2% | Arizona | 4.2% |
| Connecticut | 13.8% | Mississippi | 4.3% |
| Michigan | 13.6% | Florida | 4.8% |
| Oregon | 13.5% | Louisiana | 4.9% |

**Regional Patterns**

| Region | Average Union Rate |
|--------|-------------------|
| Northeast | 14.2% |
| Pacific | 15.0% |
| Midwest | 10.4% |
| South | 4.5% |
| Mountain West | 6.8% |

The South has consistently had the lowest union density, reflecting right-to-work laws, historical opposition to labor organizing, and industrial composition.

### Right-to-Work States

**States with Right-to-Work Laws (27 states)**

| Year Enacted | States |
|--------------|--------|
| Before 1960 | TX, FL, GA, VA, NC, SC, AZ, AR, IA, NE, NV, ND, SD, TN, UT |
| 1960-2000 | WY, KS, ID, LA, MS |
| 2001-2017 | OK, IN, MI, WI, WV, KY |
| 2023 | MI repealed right-to-work |

Right-to-work laws prohibit union security agreements requiring all workers covered by a contract to pay dues or fees. These laws weaken union finances and organizing capacity.

**Effect of Right-to-Work**

| Metric | Right-to-Work States | Non-RTW States |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| Average union density | 5.8% | 14.1% |

Black workers have historically had higher unionization rates, reflecting concentration in public sector jobs and historical civil rights-labor alliances.

**By Gender**

| 45-54 | 12.4% |
| 55-64 | 12.3% |
| 65+ | 8.6% |

Younger workers have lowest unionization, but also show highest interest in unions when surveyed.
