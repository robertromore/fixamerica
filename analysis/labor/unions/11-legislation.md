# Labor Unions: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Labor law reform is essential to reviving worker power in America. The current legal framework, established by the National Labor Relations Act (1935) and weakened by the Taft-Hartley Act (1947) and subsequent court decisions, is fundamentally inadequate to protect workers' organizing rights. This document provides draft legislation addressing the key barriers to worker organizing, along with analysis of potential loopholes and shortcomings.

## Constitutional Considerations

### First Amendment Issues

**Current Doctrine**

| Case | Holding | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|
| *NLRB v. Gissel Packing* (1969) | Employer speech protected unless threatening | Legitimizes anti-union campaigns |
| *Lechmere v. NLRB* (1992) | Limited non-employee organizer access | Restricts union communication |
| *Janus v. AFSCME* (2018) | Public sector fees are compelled speech | Weakened public sector unions |

**Reform Implications**

Captive audience meeting bans face First Amendment challenges, but can be structured as:

- Protecting worker rights, not restricting employer speech
- Requiring voluntariness, not prohibiting content
- State action limited to private employment context

### Commerce Clause Authority

Congress has clear authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate labor relations affecting interstate commerce. The NLRA has been upheld since *NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel* (1937).

## Federal Legislation

### Protecting the Right to Organize Act (PRO Act)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive reform of the National Labor Relations Act to remove barriers to organizing and restore balance in labor relations.

**Draft Text (Key Provisions)**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Protecting the Right to Organize
Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:
    (1) The National Labor Relations Act established the right
        of workers to organize and bargain collectively in 1935.
    (2) Subsequent amendments and judicial interpretations have
        eroded these rights.
    (3) Union membership has declined from 35 percent in 1954
        to 10 percent today.
    (4) This decline has contributed to wage stagnation and
        rising inequality.
    (5) Current remedies for employer violations are inadequate
        to deter unlawful conduct.
    (6) Workers who seek to exercise their rights face
        systematic employer opposition with minimal consequences.

(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are to:
    (1) Strengthen and restore workers' rights under the NLRA;
    (2) Create meaningful penalties for violations;
    (3) Streamline the organizing and bargaining process;
    (4) Extend protections to workers currently excluded.

SEC. 3. WORKER PROTECTIONS.

(a) PROTECTED CONCERTED ACTIVITY.—Section 7 of the National
    Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 157) is amended to clarify that
    protected concerted activity includes:
    (1) Political advocacy related to terms and conditions of
        employment;
    (2) Engaging in secondary activities in support of workers
        at other employers;
    (3) Intermittent work stoppages.

(b) PROHIBITION ON MANDATORY MEETINGS.—Section 8 of the
    National Labor Relations Act is amended by adding:
    "(f) It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer to
    require employees to attend employer meetings, the primary
    purpose of which is to communicate the employer's views on
    matters of religious or political nature, including matters
    relating to labor organizing, unless the employee is given
    advance notice of the meeting's subject and informed that
    attendance is voluntary and nonattendance will have no
    adverse employment consequences."

SEC. 4. UNION RECOGNITION.

(a) CARD CHECK RECOGNITION.—Section 9 of the National Labor
    Relations Act is amended to provide that:
    "(d) Whenever a petition has been filed with the Board
    showing that a majority of employees in an appropriate
    bargaining unit have designated a labor organization as
    their representative, the Board shall certify such labor
    organization as the exclusive representative without
    directing an election, unless:
    (1) The employer files a petition requesting an election
        within 14 days; and
    (2) The employer has not committed an unfair labor practice
        during the organizing campaign."

(b) EXPEDITED ELECTIONS.—Where an election is held:
    (1) The election shall be conducted within 14 days of the
        petition filing;
    (2) Pre-election hearings limited to eligibility questions
        affecting more than 20 percent of the unit;
    (3) Post-election challenges resolved within 7 days.

SEC. 5. FIRST CONTRACT ARBITRATION.

    bargaining agreement within 90 days of certification:
    (1) Either party may request mediation;
    (2) The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service shall
        assign a mediator within 7 days.

(b) ARBITRATION.—If mediation does not result in an agreement
    within 30 days:
    (1) Either party may request binding arbitration;
    (2) The arbitrator shall be selected within 14 days;
    (3) The arbitrator shall render a decision establishing the
        terms of a two-year collective bargaining agreement
        within 45 days;
    (4) The arbitrator shall consider the terms of comparable
        collective bargaining agreements and the employer's
        financial condition.

SEC. 6. PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS.

(a) CIVIL PENALTIES.—
    (1) Any employer who violates section 8(a) shall be subject
        to a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for each
        violation;
    (2) For repeat violations or violations that result in
        discharge of an employee, the penalty shall be not more
        than $100,000;
    (3) In cases of egregious or repeated violations, the Board
        may assess personal liability against directors and
        officers of the employer.

(b) COMPENSATORY DAMAGES.—Employees subject to unlawful
    discharge shall be entitled to:
    (1) Back pay without deduction for interim earnings;
    (2) Consequential damages, including medical expenses,
        credit damage, and other foreseeable harms;
    (3) Front pay when reinstatement is not appropriate;
    (4) Liquidated damages in an amount equal to back pay.

(c) INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.—The Board shall seek appropriate
    temporary injunctive relief upon the filing of a charge
    alleging termination or serious economic harm to an employee
    for union activity.

SEC. 7. RIGHT-TO-WORK PREEMPTION.

(a) PREEMPTION.—Section 14(b) of the National Labor Relations
    Act (29 U.S.C. 164(b)) is repealed.

(b) UNION SECURITY.—Section 8(a)(3) of the National Labor
    Relations Act is amended to permit agreements requiring all
    employees in a bargaining unit to pay fair share fees as a
    condition of employment after 30 days.

SEC. 8. JOINT EMPLOYER.

(a) DEFINITION.—Two or more employers shall be considered joint
    employers if each employer:
    (1) Has an employment relationship with the employees; and
    (2) Shares or codetermines matters governing the essential
        terms and conditions of employment.

(b) ESSENTIAL TERMS.—Essential terms and conditions include:
    wages, benefits, hours, hiring, discharge, discipline,
    supervision, and work direction.

(c) INDIRECT CONTROL.—An employer may be a joint employer even

    individual performing any service shall be considered an
    employee unless:
    (1) The individual is free from control and direction in
        performing the service, both under contract and in fact;
    (2) The service is performed outside the usual course of
        the business of the employer; and
    (3) The individual is customarily engaged in an independently
        established trade, occupation, or business of the same
        nature as the service performed.

(b) PRESUMPTION.—There shall be a rebuttable presumption that

## Regulatory Framework

### NLRB Rulemaking

**Current Authority**

The NLRB has authority to issue rules implementing the NLRA. Recent administrations have used rulemaking to:

- Set election procedures
- Define joint employer standards
- Clarify protected activity

**Proposed Regulations**

| Topic | Proposed Rule |
|-------|---------------|
| Election timing | Maximum 14 days from petition to election |
| Voter eligibility | Resolve disputes post-election |
| Captive audience | Require notice that attendance is voluntary |
| Joint employer | Restore 2015 *Browning-Ferris* standard |
| Graduate student employees | Confirm coverage under NLRA |

### DOL Enforcement

**Wage and Hour Division**

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Classification | Aggressive enforcement of employee status |
| Wage theft | Increased investigations |
| Retaliation | Protect workers who report violations |

**OSHA**

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Union safety committees | Support worker involvement |
| Retaliation | Protect workers who report hazards |
| Inspections | Prioritize worksites with safety complaints |

## Legal Considerations

### Preemption

**Federal Preemption of State Laws**

| Area | Preemption Status |
|------|-------------------|
| Private sector organizing | NLRA preempts state law |
| Right-to-work | Section 14(b) exception (would be repealed by PRO Act) |
| Minimum wage | States can exceed federal |
| Worker classification | Complex; varies by context |
| Public sector | State law governs |

### Constitutional Challenges

**Likely Challenges to PRO Act**

| Provision | Challenge | Response |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Captive audience ban | First Amendment | Employee protection, not speech restriction |
| Card check | Secret ballot norm | Majority authorization is valid |
| Right-to-work repeal | States' rights | Commerce Clause authority |
| Penalties | Excessive fines | Proportional to harm |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### PRO Act Loopholes

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Small employer exemption | NLRA doesn't cover employers with <$500K revenue | Medium |
| Supervisor manipulation | Reclassify workers as supervisors | High |
| Contractor conversion | Convert employees to contractors before campaign | High |
| Corporate restructuring | Create separate entities to avoid coverage | High |
| Franchise avoidance | Restructure franchise relationships | Medium |
| Religious employer exemption | Claim religious exemption | Low |
| Agricultural exemption | NLRA excludes agricultural workers | High |
| Domestic worker exemption | NLRA excludes domestic workers | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Existing exemptions maintained | Agricultural, domestic workers still excluded | Political compromise |
| NLRB capacity | Even with reform, agency understaffed | Funding limitations |
| Court interpretation | Conservative courts may narrow law | Judicial composition |
| Employer adaptation | New avoidance tactics will emerge | Adversarial system |
| State enforcement gaps | Federal law doesn't cover all situations | Federalism |
| First contract delay | Even with arbitration, can still take 6+ months | Process requirements |
| International competition | Doesn't address trade pressure | Limited scope |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Supervisor manipulation**: Define supervisor narrowly; require genuine supervisory authority over at least 50% of work time; presume employee status

2. **Contractor conversion**: Prohibit conversion to contractor status within 1 year of organizing activity; create presumption of retaliation

3. **Corporate restructuring**: Joint employer liability for all entities under common control; pierce corporate veil for labor purposes

4. **Agricultural/domestic exemptions**: Pass separate legislation (Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, Agricultural Worker Protection Act)

5. **NLRB capacity**: Mandate appropriations; authorize user fees from employers; streamline procedures

6. **Court interpretation**: Clear statutory language; legislative history; standing to defend

7. **First contract timeline**: Mandatory preliminary injunctions during bargaining; interim wage increases tied to comparable contracts

### State Model Legislation Loopholes

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| NLRA preemption | Some state laws may be preempted | High |
| Enforcement resources | State agencies often underfunded | High |
| Industry definition gaming | Employers claim to be outside covered industry | Medium |
| Multi-state operations | Apply only to in-state operations | Medium |
| Small employer exemption | Often exclude small employers | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Patchwork coverage | Varies state by state | Federalism |
| Race to bottom | States compete for business | Economic development pressure |
| Political reversibility | New administration can repeal | Electoral politics |
| Limited private enforcement | Some laws lack private right of action | Political compromise |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **NLRA preemption**: Draft laws to complement rather than conflict with NLRA; focus on areas of clear state authority

2. **Enforcement resources**: Dedicated funding streams; whistleblower incentives; qui tam provisions

3. **Industry definition**: Clear definitions with examples; authority for agency to make determinations; burden on employer to prove exemption

4. **Multi-state operations**: Apply to all work performed in state; anti-retaliation provisions for out-of-state workers

### Worker Classification Act Loopholes

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Occupational carve-outs | Exemptions for specific occupations | Medium |
| Franchise model | Franchisee classified differently | High |
| Platform company claims | Tech platforms claim to be outside "usual business" | High |
| Multi-party arrangements | Staffing agencies, temp firms | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Prong B interpretation | "Usual course of business" unclear | Inherent ambiguity |
| Existing contractor relationships | Grandfather provisions may weaken | Transition challenges |
| Gig economy lobbying | Platforms seek exemptions | Industry political power |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Prong B clarification**: Work is within usual course if it contributes to employer's product or service; consumer-facing services are within usual course

2. **Platform companies**: Explicit inclusion of platform-mediated work; algorithmic control counts as direction and control

3. **Multi-party arrangements**: Joint employment for all parties exercising control; staffing agencies and clients both liable

4. **No exemptions**: Resist occupational carve-outs; ABC test applies universally

### Cross-Cutting Issues

#### Systemic Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Affects | Mitigation |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| Court challenges | All reforms | Strong legislative findings; clear constitutional basis |
| Regulatory rollback | Agency rules | Statutory codification of key rules |
| Appropriations cuts | Enforcement | Mandatory funding; user fees |
| State preemption (by Congress) | State reforms | Build state reforms before federal action |

#### Monitoring Requirements

| Metric | Frequency | Entity |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Union membership | Annual | BLS |
| Election outcomes | Monthly | NLRB |
| ULP charges and outcomes | Quarterly | NLRB |
| First contract success | Annual | FMCS |
| Wage differentials | Annual | BLS |

#### Amendment Procedures

1. **Statutory review**: Congress should review labor law effectiveness every 5 years with mandatory GAO report

2. **Regulatory authority**: Grant agencies broad authority to address emerging loopholes through rulemaking

3. **Anti-circumvention**: Include general provisions prohibiting actions taken to avoid statutory purposes

4. **Severability**: Include severability clauses to preserve remaining provisions if parts struck down

### General Implementation Concerns

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| NLRB capacity | $500M annual appropriation; 2,500+ staff |
| Transition period | 90-180 days; guidance documents |
| Employer education | Clear FAQs; compliance assistance |
| Worker education | "Know your rights" campaigns |
| Coordination | Interagency task force |
| Data collection | Enhanced reporting requirements |
