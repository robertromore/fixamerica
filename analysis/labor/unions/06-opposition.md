## Their Tactics

### Captive Audience Meetings

**How They Work**

1. Employer schedules mandatory meeting during work hours
2. Workers must attend or face discipline
3. Management presents anti-union arguments
4. Workers cannot respond or leave
5. Often held multiple times during campaign

**Content**

| Message | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Unions are outside third parties" | Workers choose their own representatives |
| "You'll lose your direct relationship with management" | Collective bargaining doesn't prevent talking |
| "Dues will cost you money" | Union premium far exceeds dues |
| "We might have to close the plant" | Often illegal threat, rarely followed through |
| "Negotiations start from zero" | Misleading; existing benefits continue |

**Prevalence**

- 89% of campaigns include captive audience meetings
- Average of 10+ meetings per campaign
- Reduce union win rate by 10-15 percentage points
- Workers cannot hold equivalent meetings

### One-on-One Meetings

**Supervisor Conversations**

| Tactic | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| "Friendly" check-ins | Identify union supporters |
| Promise improvements | Undermine union's appeal |
| Express disappointment | Emotional manipulation |
| Ask about union activity | Surveillance disguised as concern |
| Warn about consequences | Veiled threats |

Supervisors often receive extensive anti-union training, including scripts and talking points.

### Illegal Tactics

**Prevalence of Violations**

| Tactic | Frequency in Campaigns |
|--------|----------------------|
| Threats to close facility | 57% |
| Threats to cut wages/benefits | 47% |
| Firing union supporters | 34% |
| Surveillance of workers | 31% |
| Bribes or special favors | 22% |
| Promises if union loses | 54% |

**Why Violations Continue**

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Weak penalties | Back pay minus interim earnings |
| Slow enforcement | Years to resolve |
| Burden on workers | Must prove violation |
| Rare criminal prosecution | Almost never happens |
| Worth the risk | Benefits exceed costs |

### Delay Tactics

**Election Delays**

| Tactic | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Bargaining unit challenges | Adds months to process |
| Eligibility disputes | Question who can vote |
| Multiple appeals | Years of delay possible |
| Request postponements | Administrative delays |

**First Contract Delays**

| Tactic | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Challenge election results | More months/years |
| Surface bargaining | Go through motions without agreement |
| Information requests | Claim confidentiality |
| Unilateral changes | Destabilize workforce |

### Legal Strategies

**Employer-Favorable Precedents Sought**

| Strategy | Goal |
|----------|------|
| Narrow bargaining units | Easier to defeat |
| Expand management exemptions | Fewer workers can organize |
| Limit union access | Workers can't hear union message |
| Expand employer speech | More anti-union communication |
| Weaken remedies | Reduce penalty for violations |

### Post-Election Tactics

**If Union Wins**

| Tactic | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Challenge election | Overturn result |
| Delay bargaining | Workers lose faith |
| Surface bargaining | Never reach agreement |
| Implement changes | Undermine union |
| Prepare for decertification | Get rid of union |

37% of new unions never achieve a first contract.

## Their Messaging

### "Unions Are Outsiders"

**The Argument**

- "Unions are third parties"
- "They don't know your workplace"
- "Outside agitators"
- "Union bosses"

**Reality**

- Workers choose their own representatives
- Union is the workers themselves
- "Third party" framing obscures worker agency
- Employers hire outside consultants too

**Counter-Message**

> "A union is you and your coworkers. Outside consultants are the ones the company hired to fight you."

### "You Could Lose What You Have"

**The Argument**

- "Everything is negotiable"
- "Bargaining starts from zero"
- "You might end up with less"

**Reality**

- Existing terms typically continue during bargaining
- 98% of contracts include existing or better benefits
- Company would have to explain why it's cutting benefits

**Counter-Message**

> "The company is telling you they might punish you for organizing. That's exactly why you need a union."

### "Dues Are a Waste"

**The Argument**

- "Union dues are expensive"
- "You're paying for union boss salaries"
- "That money could be in your pocket"

**Reality**

| Item | Typical Amount |
|------|----------------|
| Union dues | 1-2% of pay |
| Union wage premium | 10-20% of pay |
| Net benefit | 8-18% higher |

**Counter-Message**

> "Would you turn down a 10-20% raise because someone asked for 2% of it?"

### "Strikes Mean Lost Wages"

**The Argument**

- "Unions will force you to strike"
- "You'll lose your paycheck"
- "The company will replace you"

**Reality**

- 98%+ of contracts reached without strikes
- Workers vote on whether to strike
- Strike funds provide support
- Most strikes are successful

**Counter-Message**

> "Strikes are rare, and workers decide whether to strike. The bigger question is why you need to threaten a strike to be treated fairly."

### "We're Already a Family"

**The Argument**

- "We value our employees"
- "Our door is always open"
- "We don't need a union to communicate"

**Reality**

- If true, why fight the union?
- "Family" rhetoric masks power imbalance
- Promises without contract aren't enforceable

**Counter-Message**

> "If management respects workers so much, they should have no problem putting it in writing."

## Their Weaknesses

### Public Opinion

**Union Approval at Historic Highs**

| Year | Approve | Disapprove |
|------|---------|------------|
| 2009 | 48% | 45% |
| 2022 | 71% | 21% |

Employers are defending an increasingly unpopular position.

### Extreme Inequality Exposure

Current inequality levels are politically difficult to defend:

- CEO pay 350x worker pay
- Billionaires pay lower tax rates than workers
- Record corporate profits amid worker struggles
- Pandemic exposed "essential worker" treatment

### Evidence Against Their Claims

**Research Findings**

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Unions hurt economy | IMF/OECD find unions reduce inequality without harming growth |
| Unions kill jobs | Job growth similar in union vs. non-union sectors |
| Workers don't want unions | 48% of non-union workers would vote for one |
| Unions are corrupt | Corruption rare, employer violations common |

### Internal Contradictions

| Contradiction | Exposure |
|---------------|----------|
| "We care about workers" | Then why spend millions fighting them? |
| "Market competition" | But labor market power is OK? |
| "Freedom of association" | Except for workers? |
| "Small government" | But use government to restrict unions? |

### Generational Change

- Younger workers more pro-union
- Less attachment to anti-union ideology
- Direct experience with inequality
- Social media enables new organizing

## Counter-Strategies

### Expose Employer Spending

**Transparency**

- Publicize consultant fees
- Document captive audience meetings
- Track ULP charges
- Name and shame bad actors

### Frame the Debate

**Reframing**

| Employer Frame | Worker Frame |
|----------------|--------------|
| "Third party" | "Your coworkers" |
| "Union bosses" | "Elected representatives" |
| "Starting from zero" | "Building on what you have" |
| "Dues money" | "Investment in your future" |
| "Family culture" | "Power imbalance" |

### Build Broad Coalitions

- Civil rights organizations
- Environmental groups
- Consumer advocates
- Local businesses

### Political Action

**Targets**

- Elect labor-friendly officials
