# Retirement Security: Overview

## Executive Summary

America faces a retirement crisis of historic proportions. The shift from defined benefit pensions to 401(k) plans has transferred risk from employers to workers, leaving most Americans unprepared for retirement. Pension coverage collapsed from 38% of private sector workers in 1980 to just 15% today, while the 401(k) system that replaced it has proven inadequate for building retirement wealth. The median 401(k) balance for workers aged 55-64 is approximately $35,000, enough to generate only about $150 per month in retirement income.

Half of American workers have no workplace retirement plan at all. Gig workers, part-time employees, and those at small businesses are largely excluded from employer-sponsored retirement savings. The result is a nation where Social Security, never designed to be the sole source of retirement income, provides the majority of income for most retirees.

**The Scope of the Crisis**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Workers without workplace retirement plan | 57 million (nearly half of workforce) |
| Median 401(k) balance (ages 55-64) | ~$35,000 |
| Retirees relying on Social Security for >50% of income | 65% |
| Retirees relying on Social Security for >90% of income | 40% |
| Retirement savings deficit (aggregate shortfall) | $7-14 trillion |
| Private sector workers with pension | 15% (down from 38% in 1980) |

The retirement crisis intersects with every major dimension of inequality. Racial wealth gaps compound into retirement: white families have 7 times the retirement savings of Black families. Women, who earn less during working years and live longer, face heightened retirement insecurity. Low-wage workers, who most need retirement savings, are least likely to have access to plans.

## Why Retirement Security Matters

### Individual Impact

Retirement insecurity affects every aspect of older Americans' lives:

- **Poverty in old age**: Without adequate savings, millions face poverty after working careers
- **Health outcomes**: Financial stress affects physical and mental health
- **Housing security**: Unable to maintain homes or afford rent
- **Family burden**: Children support parents at expense of their own security
- **Delayed retirement**: Working into 70s and beyond out of necessity, not choice

### Economic Consequences

Inadequate retirement savings affects the broader economy:

- **Reduced consumer spending**: Retirees with inadequate savings cut consumption
- **Increased public costs**: Greater demand for safety net programs
- **Intergenerational effects**: Families strain to support elderly members
- **Labor market distortions**: Older workers unable to retire block opportunities
- **Healthcare costs**: Delayed care leads to higher eventual costs

### Social Implications

Retirement insecurity undermines the social contract:

- **Broken promises**: Workers who played by the rules face insecurity
- **Inequality amplification**: Lifetime inequality compounds in retirement
- **Generational tensions**: Young and old compete for limited resources
- **Democratic participation**: Economic insecurity affects civic engagement

This subtopic covers:

- **Retirement plan coverage**: Who has access to workplace plans
- **Savings adequacy**: Whether savings meet retirement needs
- **Plan types**: Pensions, 401(k)s, IRAs, and alternatives
- **Social Security**: The foundation of retirement security
- **Gig and non-traditional workers**: Those excluded from the system
- **Racial and gender disparities**: How inequality compounds
- **State-run retirement programs**: OregonSaves, CalSavers, and others
- **International comparisons**: How other countries ensure retirement security
- **Reform proposals**: Auto-IRA, Social Security expansion, portable benefits

## Key Questions

1. **How did we get here?** What caused the shift from pensions to 401(k)s, and why did it leave workers worse off?

2. **Who is covered?** Which workers have access to retirement plans, and why are so many excluded?

3. **Are savings adequate?** Do current retirement savings levels meet actual retirement needs?

4. **What about Social Security?** How central is Social Security to retirement, and what is its future?

5. **Who falls through the cracks?** How do gig workers, part-time employees, and others access retirement savings?

6. **What works elsewhere?** How do other countries achieve broader, more adequate retirement security?

7. **What can be done?** What reforms could address the retirement crisis at federal, state, and individual levels?

## The Central Problem

The American retirement system rests on a "three-legged stool" that has collapsed into one leg:

**The Three-Legged Stool Model**

| Leg | Original Design | Current Reality |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| Social Security | Supplement to pensions | Primary income source for most |
| Employer pensions | Guaranteed retirement income | Largely disappeared |
| Personal savings | Additional security | Minimal for most workers |

The system was never designed for Social Security to carry most of the weight. When employer pensions were common, Social Security replaced approximately 40% of pre-retirement income, with pensions covering another 20-30%. Now, for most retirees, Social Security alone must do what three sources once provided.

**The 401(k) Experiment**

The 401(k) was never meant to replace pensions. It began as a tax loophole for executives' bonuses in 1978 and was gradually adopted as the primary retirement vehicle. But unlike pensions, 401(k)s:

| Pension | 401(k) |
|---------|--------|
| Employer bears investment risk | Worker bears investment risk |
| Professional management | Individual investment decisions |
| Guaranteed income for life | Savings can run out |
| Automatic participation | Often requires opt-in |
| Employer funds entirely | Worker must contribute |

The result: workers who lack financial expertise must make complex investment decisions affecting their entire future, while bearing all the risk of market downturns, longevity, and inflation.

## The Stakes

### Aggregate Retirement Shortfall

Estimates of the total retirement savings gap range from $7 trillion to $14 trillion. This represents:

- The difference between what Americans have saved and what they need
- Future demands on safety net programs
- Lost economic activity from reduced retirement spending
- Increased dependency ratios as population ages

### Demographic Pressures

| Trend | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Aging population | More retirees, fewer workers |
| Longer lifespans | Savings must last longer |
| Rising healthcare costs | Greater expenses in retirement |
| Declining birth rates | Smaller working-age population |
| Delayed family formation | Less intergenerational support |

### The Coming Wave

The retirement crisis will intensify as Baby Boomers continue retiring:

- 10,000 Americans turn 65 every day
- Many have inadequate savings
- Social Security faces long-term funding challenges
- Healthcare costs continue rising
- Long-term care needs growing

## Recent Developments

### Legislative Action

- **SECURE Act (2019)**: Expanded access, raised RMD age
- **SECURE 2.0 (2022)**: Auto-enrollment mandates, emergency savings, student loan matching
- **State programs**: 19 states have enacted state-run retirement programs

### Market and Economic Factors

| Development | Impact on Retirement |
|-------------|---------------------|
| COVID-19 pandemic | Early withdrawals, job losses |
| Inflation (2022-2024) | Eroded purchasing power |
| Interest rate increases | Better annuity rates, bond yields |
| Market volatility | Sequence-of-returns risk |
| Multi-employer pension crisis | Fund failures, PBGC strain |

### Emerging Approaches

- Automatic enrollment becoming standard
- State-run auto-IRA programs expanding
- Portable benefits experiments
- Emergency savings integration
- Lifetime income options in 401(k)s

## Path Forward

Addressing the retirement crisis requires action at multiple levels:

### Federal Policy

1. **Expand Social Security**: Increase benefits, especially for low earners
2. **Universal coverage**: Require all employers to offer retirement plans
3. **Auto-enrollment**: Make saving the default
4. **Strengthen PBGC**: Protect remaining pensions

### State Innovation

1. **State-run retirement programs**: Continue expansion of OregonSaves model
2. **Supplement federal programs**: Additional state-level protections
3. **Address coverage gaps**: Target gig workers and small business employees

### Employer Action

1. **Offer plans**: All employers should provide retirement savings
2. **Match contributions**: Employer matches significantly increase savings
3. **Auto-escalation**: Automatically increase contribution rates
4. **Financial wellness**: Provide education and planning tools

### Individual Action

1. **Maximize contributions**: Save as much as possible
2. **Start early**: Time is the most powerful factor
3. **Avoid early withdrawals**: Protect retirement savings
4. **Plan for longevity**: Assume longer life expectancy

## Key Takeaways

1. **Crisis is now**: The retirement security crisis is not future; millions of current retirees struggle
2. **System failure**: The shift from pensions to 401(k)s transferred risk to workers who cannot bear it
3. **Coverage gaps**: Half of workers have no workplace retirement plan
4. **Inadequate savings**: Median 401(k) balances cannot fund retirement
5. **Social Security dependence**: Most retirees rely on Social Security for majority of income
6. **Inequality compounds**: Racial and gender gaps widen in retirement
7. **Reform possible**: Policy solutions exist; other countries do better
8. **State innovation**: State-run programs showing promise
