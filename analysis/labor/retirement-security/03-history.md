# Retirement Security: History

## Origins

### Before Pensions: The Problem of Old Age

For most of American history, old age meant continued work, family dependence, or poverty. Before the 20th century:

- **Most worked until death**: No retirement concept for most workers
- **Family support**: Extended families cared for elderly members
- **Poor houses**: Public institutions for destitute elderly
- **No life expectancy buffer**: Average lifespan around 47 years in 1900
- **Limited savings**: Low wages made saving impossible for most

### Early Pension Experiments

**Government Pensions**

| Program | Year | Coverage |
|---------|------|----------|
| Military pensions (Revolutionary War) | 1776+ | Veterans |
| Civil War pensions | 1862+ | Union veterans and widows |
| Railroad Retirement | 1934 | Railroad workers |
| Civil Service Retirement | 1920 | Federal employees |

**Early Corporate Pensions**

| Company | Year | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| American Express | 1875 | Retain workers |
| B&O Railroad | 1880 | Reduce turnover |
| Carnegie Steel | 1901 | Welfare capitalism |
| AT&T | 1913 | Employee loyalty |

These early plans covered few workers and were often revocable at employer discretion.

## Key Turning Points

### The Social Security Act (1935)

The Great Depression exposed the vulnerability of elderly Americans. By 1934, over half of seniors could not support themselves.

**Social Security's Design**

| Feature | Original Design | Rationale |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Contributory | Workers pay in, receive benefits | Political durability |
| Universal (eventually) | Cover most workers | Broad base |
| Wage-indexed | Benefits rise with economy | Maintain relative position |
| Pay-as-you-go | Current workers fund retirees | No prefunding needed |

**Initial Limitations**

| Exclusion | Workers Affected | Later Resolution |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| Agricultural workers | 3 million | Added 1950-1954 |
| Domestic workers | 2 million | Added 1950-1954 |
| Self-employed | Millions | Added 1951 |
| Non-profit employees | Millions | Added 1950-1983 |

*Note: These exclusions disproportionately affected Black workers.*

### The Post-War Pension Boom (1945-1980)

World War II created conditions for pension expansion:

**Factors Driving Pension Growth**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Wage controls | Could offer pensions instead of pay increases |
| Strong unions | Negotiated pension benefits |
| Tax incentives | Employer contributions tax-deductible |
| Tight labor markets | Benefits helped attract workers |
| NLRB ruling (1948) | Pensions subject to collective bargaining |

**Pension Coverage Growth**

| Year | Workers Covered | Percentage |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| 1940 | 4 million | 15% |
| 1950 | 10 million | 25% |
| 1960 | 23 million | 41% |
| 1970 | 30 million | 45% |
| 1980 | 38 million | 46% |

### ERISA and Pension Protection (1974)

The Studebaker plant closure in 1963 left 4,500 workers without promised pensions. After years of scandals, Congress acted.

**Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)**

| Provision | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Fiduciary standards | Protect plan assets |
| Vesting requirements | Workers earn benefits |
| Funding rules | Plans must be funded |
| PBGC insurance | Government backup for failed plans |
| Reporting requirements | Transparency |

**ERISA's Unintended Effects**

| Effect | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Compliance costs | Small employers dropped plans |
| Liability exposure | Employers feared lawsuits |
| Funding requirements | Made pensions expensive |
| Regulatory burden | Created incentive for alternatives |

### The 401(k) Revolution (1978-Present)

**The Accidental Retirement Plan**

The 401(k) was not designed to replace pensions. It began as section 401(k) of the Revenue Act of 1978, intended to clarify tax treatment of profit-sharing bonuses.

**Timeline of 401(k) Evolution**

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1978 | Section 401(k) added to tax code |
| 1980 | Ted Benna creates first 401(k) plan at Johnson Companies |
| 1981 | IRS issues rules allowing payroll deductions |
| 1982 | Large employers begin offering 401(k)s |
| 1984 | Congress adds non-discrimination rules |
| 1996 | 401(k) assets exceed $1 trillion |
| 2006 | Pension Protection Act encourages auto-enrollment |
| 2024 | 401(k) assets exceed $7 trillion |

**The Shift from DB to DC**

| Year | Defined Benefit | Defined Contribution | Both |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|------|
| 1980 | 38% | 8% | 8% |
| 1990 | 26% | 15% | 12% |
| 2000 | 19% | 27% | 9% |
| 2010 | 10% | 35% | 8% |
| 2023 | 4% | 33% | 11% |

### Multi-Employer Pension Crisis (1980s-Present)

Union-negotiated multi-employer plans, common in trucking, construction, and mining, faced severe challenges.

**Crisis Factors**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Industry decline | Fewer contributing employers |
| Union membership drop | Smaller contribution base |
| Employer bankruptcies | Remaining employers inherit obligations |
| Market downturns | Underfunding worsens |
| Demographics | Retirees outnumber active workers |

**Major Plan Failures**

| Plan | Workers/Retirees | Status |
|------|------------------|--------|
| Central States Teamsters | 400,000 | Received $36B rescue (2022) |
| UMWA Health and Retirement | 120,000 | Partially rescued |
| Ironworkers Local 17 | 14,000 | PBGC assistance |

## Lessons from the Past

### What Worked

**Social Security Success Factors**

| Factor | Why It Worked |
|--------|---------------|
| Universal coverage | Everyone participates |
| Automatic enrollment | No opt-in required |
| Professional management | Investment decisions made by experts |
| Lifetime payments | Cannot outlive benefits |
| Inflation protection | COLA maintains purchasing power |
| Political durability | "Third rail" protects program |

**Traditional Pension Strengths**

| Factor | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| Pooled risk | Longevity risk shared |
| Professional management | Better investment outcomes |
| Automatic saving | Employer-funded |
| Retirement income | Predictable payments |
| Employer commitment | Long-term relationship |

### What Failed

**401(k) Structural Problems**

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Opt-in design | Many never participate |
| Individual risk | Workers bear all market risk |
| Leakage | Early withdrawals deplete savings |
| High fees | Erode returns |
| Lump sum distribution | No lifetime income |
| Complexity | Poor investment decisions |

**The Risk Transfer**

| Risk | Traditional Pension | 401(k) |
|------|--------------------|---------|
| Investment | Employer | Worker |
| Longevity | Employer (pooled) | Worker (individual) |
| Inflation | Often employer (COLA) | Worker |
| Contribution adequacy | Employer | Worker |
| Timing | Employer | Worker |

### Historical Patterns

**Recurring Themes**

| Theme | Historical Examples |
|-------|---------------------|
| Coverage gaps | Pre-Social Security, current non-coverage |
| Broken promises | Studebaker, pension freezes |
| Market vulnerability | 2000, 2008 crashes |
| Policy lag | ERISA (11 years after Studebaker) |
| State innovation | State pensions preceded Social Security |
| Employer resistance | Opposition to every expansion |

**What History Teaches**

1. **Universal systems work**: Social Security covers 96% of workers
2. **Voluntary systems fail**: 401(k)s leave half uncovered
3. **Automatic beats opt-in**: Participation rates prove it
4. **Risk pooling essential**: Individual risk bearing fails
5. **Professional management superior**: Better outcomes than DIY
6. **Lifetime income crucial**: Lump sums create insecurity
7. **Employer incentives insufficient**: Coverage gaps persist

### The Missed Path

Other countries chose differently after WWII:

| Country | Choice | Result |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Netherlands | Mandatory industry pensions | 91% coverage |
| Australia | Mandatory employer contributions (1992) | 91% coverage |
| UK | Auto-enrollment (2012) | 77% coverage |
| USA | Voluntary 401(k) | 53% coverage |

## The Current Moment

The retirement system stands at a crossroads:

**Converging Factors**

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Baby Boomer retirements | Peak demand on inadequate savings |
| Gig economy growth | More workers outside system |
| Pension phase-out nearly complete | Few defined benefit plans remain |
| State program expansion | Alternative models emerging |
| Political attention | Bipartisan concern (SECURE Acts) |
| Public support | Broad backing for retirement security |

The question is whether policymakers will learn from history's lessons or continue the experiment of individual risk-bearing that has left most Americans underprepared for retirement.
