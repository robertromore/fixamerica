# Retirement Security: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

### Core Values

**Universal Access**

- Every worker should have access to a retirement savings vehicle
- Access should not depend on employer size or type
- Self-employed and gig workers must be included
- Part-time workers should have equal access

**Adequacy**

- Savings should be sufficient for dignified retirement
- Default contribution rates should produce adequate accumulation
- Social Security should remain the foundation
- Gap between income groups should narrow

**Simplicity**

- Enrollment should be automatic
- Investment decisions should be simplified
- Accounts should be portable across jobs
- Fees should be transparent and low

**Security**

- Workers should not bear unmanageable risk
- Lifetime income options should be available
- Emergency access should not devastate retirement
- Protections against fraud and abuse

### Criteria for Evaluating Solutions
