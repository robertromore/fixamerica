# Retirement Security: Overview

America faces a retirement crisis of historic proportions. The shift from defined benefit pensions to 401(k) plans has transferred risk from employers to workers, leaving most Americans unprepared for retirement. Pension coverage collapsed from 38% of private sector workers in 1980 to just 15% today, while the 401(k) system that replaced it has proven inadequate for building retirement wealth. The median 401(k) balance for workers aged 55-64 is approximately $35,000, enough to generate only about $150 per month in retirement income.
