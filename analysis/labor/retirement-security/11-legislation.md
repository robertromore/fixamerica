# Retirement Security: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Addressing America's retirement crisis requires legislation at multiple levels: federal laws establishing universal coverage and strengthening Social Security, state laws implementing auto-IRA programs, and regulatory reforms to protect savers. This document provides draft legislative text for comprehensive retirement security reform, with analysis of potential loopholes and mechanisms for addressing them.

## Federal Legislation

### Universal Retirement Savings Act

**Purpose**: Require all employers to offer retirement savings access and ensure automatic enrollment for all workers.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Approximately 57 million American workers lack access to
    workplace retirement savings plans.
(2) Workers with access to automatic payroll deduction are
    15 times more likely to save for retirement.
(3) Automatic enrollment increases participation rates from
    approximately 40 percent to over 90 percent.
(4) The shift from defined benefit to defined contribution
    plans has transferred retirement risk to workers who
    are ill-equipped to manage it.
(5) State automatic IRA programs have demonstrated the
    feasibility of providing universal retirement savings access.
(6) A federal standard is necessary to ensure all American
    workers have access to retirement savings regardless of
    employer size or state of residence.

    $1,900 per month is insufficient for dignified retirement.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause**

Federal retirement mandates are well-supported by precedent:

| Precedent | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| FLSA minimum wage | Federal labor standards constitutional |
| ERISA | Federal pension regulation constitutional |
| ACA employer mandate | Federal employer requirements constitutional |

**Tenth Amendment**

State auto-IRA programs do not violate Tenth Amendment:

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| State programs | State police powers support |
| Federal mandate | Applies to private employers, not states |
| ERISA safe harbor | Federal accommodation of state programs |

**Due Process**

| Requirement | Compliance |
|-------------|------------|
| Notice | Clear employer requirements |
| Hearing | Appeal process for penalties |
| Reasonableness | Phase-in period, small employer exemptions |

### ERISA Preemption Analysis

**State Program Protection**

| Factor | Analysis |
|--------|----------|
| Not an ERISA plan | Payroll deduction IRA, not employer plan |
| Employer role limited | No plan sponsor status |
| No employer contributions | Further separates from ERISA |
| DOL safe harbor | Federal recognition of state programs |

**Federal Legislation Preemption**

| Scenario | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Federal mandate without safe harbor | Could preempt state programs |
| Federal mandate with safe harbor | Preserves state programs |
| Federal floor, state ceiling | Best approach |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Strengths | Limitations |
