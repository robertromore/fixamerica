# Retirement Security: Current State

## The Problem Today

### The Coverage Crisis

Nearly half of American workers have no access to workplace retirement plans. This coverage gap has persisted for decades despite policy efforts and creates a fundamental barrier to retirement security.

**Workplace Retirement Plan Access**

| Category | Access Rate |
|----------|-------------|
| All private sector workers | 53% |
| Full-time workers | 65% |
| Part-time workers | 22% |
| Workers at firms with <50 employees | 28% |
| Workers at firms with 500+ employees | 75% |
| Bottom wage quartile | 31% |
| Top wage quartile | 77% |

**Workers Without Access (57 Million)**

| Sector | Without Access |
|--------|----------------|
| Accommodation and food services | 72% |
| Agriculture | 68% |
| Retail trade | 54% |
| Construction | 53% |
| Administrative services | 51% |

### The Savings Crisis

Even among those with access, actual savings are dangerously inadequate for most workers.

**401(k) Balances by Age**

| Age Group | Median Balance | Mean Balance |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| 20s | $7,800 | $16,500 |
| 30s | $21,000 | $54,000 |
| 40s | $32,000 | $116,000 |
| 50s | $57,000 | $185,000 |
| 55-64 | $71,000 | $232,000 |
| 60-69 | $89,000 | $259,000 |

*Note: Large gap between median and mean indicates highly skewed distribution; a small number of high savers pull up the average.*

**Total Retirement Savings (All Accounts)**

| Age 55-64 | Median | Mean |
|-----------|--------|------|
| All households | $134,000 | $458,000 |
| With retirement accounts | $185,000 | $612,000 |
| Without retirement accounts | $0 | N/A |

### The Adequacy Gap

Financial planners generally recommend replacing 70-80% of pre-retirement income. Most Americans fall far short.

**Retirement Readiness by Income**

| Income Level | Adequate Savings | Likely Shortfall |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| Bottom quintile | 12% | $50,000+ |
| Second quintile | 24% | $120,000+ |
| Middle quintile | 35% | $200,000+ |
| Fourth quintile | 52% | $250,000+ |
| Top quintile | 68% | $300,000+ |
