# Retirement Security: Roadmap

## Strategic Overview

### Theory of Change

Reform of the retirement system requires building from state-level successes to federal action, while simultaneously protecting and improving Social Security. The path proceeds from:

1. **State experimentation** proves feasibility
2. **Federal facilitation** supports and spreads state models
3. **Federal mandate** achieves universal coverage
4. **Social Security strengthening** completes the foundation
