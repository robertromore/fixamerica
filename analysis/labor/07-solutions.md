# Labor: Solutions

## Overview

Addressing America's labor crisis requires reforms across multiple dimensions: strengthening worker organizing rights, raising workplace standards, extending protections to excluded workers, and building new systems for economic security. Solutions range from incremental improvements within current frameworks to fundamental restructuring of labor relations. The most effective approach combines legal reform, robust enforcement, and worker power-building.

## Alternative Approaches

### Market-Based (Conservative)

| Proposal | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **Deregulation** | Evidence shows harms workers |
| **Right-to-work expansion** | Weakens worker voice |
| **Reduce minimum wage** | Would increase poverty |
| **Voluntary benefits** | Leaves millions uncovered |

### Libertarian Paternalism

| Proposal | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **Nudges over mandates** | Insufficient for structural problems |
| **Information disclosure** | Useful but not sufficient |
| **Portable benefits only** | Doesn't address power imbalance |

### Social Democratic

| Proposal | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **Universal basic income** | Doesn't address workplace power |
| **Job guarantee** | Could complement labor reform |
| **Medicare for All** | Decouples healthcare, increases mobility |
| **Robust safety net** | Increases worker bargaining power |

### Labor-Led

| Proposal | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **Union-only focus** | Necessary but not sufficient |
| **Sectoral bargaining** | Promising, requires political power |
| **Worker ownership** | Complementary to collective bargaining |
| **Alt-labor models** | Worker centers, minority unions |

## Trade-offs

### Coverage vs. Flexibility

| Tension | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| Broad standards may not fit all | Minimum standards with room above |
| Classification affects access | Universal protection regardless |

### Enforcement vs. Administrative Burden

| Tension | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| Strong enforcement requires resources | Adequate funding, efficient systems |
| Compliance costs | Simplification, employer support |

### Federal vs. State Action

| Tension | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| Federal preemption blocks state innovation | Allow states to exceed federal |
| State variation creates confusion | Clear floor with portability |

### Union vs. Universal Standards

| Tension | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| Unions work for members, not all | Sectoral bargaining benefits all |
| Union-only focus excludes most workers | Multiple mechanisms for voice |

## Recommended Approach

### Near-Term

1. Pass PRO Act or components through reconciliation

5. Use executive authority to expand protections

### Medium-Term

1. Sectoral bargaining in key industries
2. Worker classification reform
3. Social Security expansion
4. Portable benefits system
5. State and local innovation

### Long-Term

1. Universal worker voice mechanisms
