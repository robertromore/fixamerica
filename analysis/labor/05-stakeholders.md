# Labor: Stakeholders

## Overview

Labor policy involves a complex web of stakeholders with competing interests. Employers benefit from the status quo of weak worker power, while workers, their families, and communities bear the costs. Understanding who gains, who loses, and who holds power reveals the political dynamics that sustain current conditions and identifies potential coalitions for reform.
