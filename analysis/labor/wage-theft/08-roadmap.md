# Wage Theft: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap provides a phased approach to addressing wage theft, recognizing that comprehensive reform will require years of sustained effort across multiple fronts. The strategy prioritizes achievable early wins that build momentum for larger structural changes.

## Strategic Framework

### Theory of Change

**Building Blocks Approach**

1. **Local and state victories** demonstrate what works and build political power
2. **Worker organizing** creates constituency for reform
3. **Public awareness** shifts narrative from "violations" to "theft"
4. **Coalition building** assembles political coalition for federal reform
5. **Federal action** establishes national floor
6. **Ongoing enforcement** makes gains permanent

### Sequencing Principles

|-----------|-------------|
| Start where we can win | Local/state before federal |
| Build proof of concept | Demonstrate solutions work |
| Grow constituency | Organize affected workers |
| Layer reforms | Each victory enables next |
