# Wage Theft: History

## Origins

### Pre-FLSA Era (Before 1938)

Before federal wage and hour protections, worker exploitation was endemic:

**The Industrial Age**

| Era | Conditions |
|-----|------------|
| 1870-1900 | 12-16 hour workdays, child labor, no minimum wage |
| 1900-1930 | Gradual state reforms, but widespread violations |
| The Depression | Mass unemployment, desperate workers, rampant exploitation |

**Early State Laws**

| Year | State | Law |
|------|-------|-----|
| 1912 | Massachusetts | First state minimum wage (women only) |
| 1913 | 8 states | Minimum wage laws (mostly women/children) |
| 1923 | Supreme Court | *Adkins v. Children's Hospital* strikes down DC minimum wage |
| 1930s | Various states | Laws repeatedly struck down as unconstitutional |

The Supreme Court's *Lochner*-era jurisprudence blocked state wage protections, leaving workers with no legal recourse against exploitation.

### The Fair Labor Standards Act (1938)

**Context**

The FLSA emerged from the New Deal amid:
- Mass unemployment (25%+ at Depression's peak)
- Child labor epidemic
- Extreme working hours
- Poverty wages
- Growing labor movement demanding change

**Original FLSA Provisions**

| Provision | Original Standard |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Minimum wage | $0.25/hour |
| Overtime | Time-and-a-half over 44 hours |
| Child labor | Restrictions on employment under 16 |
| Coverage | About 20% of workforce |

**Exclusions by Design**

The FLSA's major exclusions reflected the political compromises necessary to pass it:

| Exclusion | Reason | Impact |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Agricultural workers | Southern Democrat demands | Excluded largely Black sharecroppers |
| Domestic workers | Southern Democrat demands | Excluded largely Black women |
| Small businesses | Business lobby | Millions uncovered |
| Many service workers | Limited scope | Service economy uncovered |

These exclusions, rooted in the racial politics of the Jim Crow era, continue to affect wage protections today.

**Constitutional Validation**

| Case | Year | Holding |
|------|------|---------|
| *West Coast Hotel v. Parrish* | 1937 | Upheld state minimum wage law |
| *United States v. Darby* | 1941 | Upheld FLSA's constitutionality |
| *Overnight Motor Transport v. Missel* | 1942 | Clarified overtime provisions |

The Court's shift on economic regulation (the "switch in time that saved nine") enabled federal wage protections to survive.

## Key Turning Points

### Expansion Era (1938-1980)

**Minimum Wage Increases**

| Year | Minimum Wage | Equivalent (2023$) |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1938 | $0.25 | $5.35 |
| 1950 | $0.75 | $9.45 |
| 1961 | $1.15 | $11.70 |
| 1968 | $1.60 | $14.00 (peak) |
| 1974 | $2.00 | $12.25 |
| 1980 | $3.10 | $11.40 |

**Coverage Expansions**

| Year | Change | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1961 | Retail expansion | Large retailers covered |
| 1966 | State/local government | Public employees covered |
| 1974 | Domestic workers | Most domestic workers covered |
| 1977 | Agricultural workers | Minimum wage for farm workers |

**Enforcement Peak**

| Year | WHD Investigators | Comments |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| 1941 | 400 | Initial build-up |
| 1960 | 1,000 | Steady growth |
| 1970 | 1,200 | Continued expansion |
| 1980 | 1,600 | Historical peak |

At its peak, DOL's Wage and Hour Division had nearly 1,600 investigators and was widely seen as an effective enforcement agency.

### Decline Era (1981-2000)

**Reagan Administration Changes**

| Policy | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Budget cuts | WHD budget reduced 30% |
| Staff reductions | Investigators cut from 1,600 to under 1,000 |
| Deregulation philosophy | Less proactive enforcement |
| Minimum wage freeze | No increase for 9 years (1981-1990) |

**Investigator Decline**

| Year | WHD Investigators | Change from 1980 |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1980 | 1,600 | Baseline |
| 1985 | 1,100 | -31% |
| 1990 | 950 | -41% |
| 1995 | 900 | -44% |
| 2000 | 945 | -41% |

**Inflation Erosion**

The federal minimum wage lost significant purchasing power:

| Year | Minimum Wage | Real Value (1968$) |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1968 | $1.60 | $1.60 (peak) |
| 1981 | $3.35 | $1.35 |
| 1990 | $3.80 | $1.07 |
| 2000 | $5.15 | $1.10 |

By 2000, the minimum wage had lost about 30% of its 1968 purchasing power.

### Court Erosion of Protections

**Key Hostile Decisions**

| Case | Year | Impact |
|------|------|--------|
| *Auer v. Robbins* | 1997 | Narrow interpretation of overtime exemptions |
| *Christensen v. Harris County* | 2000 | Limited comp time protections |
| *Alden v. Maine* | 1999 | States immune from FLSA suits |
| Various | 1990s-2000s | Expanded "white collar" exemptions |

The courts increasingly interpreted FLSA exemptions broadly, removing workers from protections.

### Rise of the Contingent Workforce (1980-2000)

**Workforce Changes**

| Trend | Impact on Wage Theft |
|-------|---------------------|
| Temp agencies | Workers lack direct employer relationship |
| Subcontracting | Fissured workplace, diffused responsibility |
| Part-time work | Often exempt from benefits, easier to cheat |
| Franchising | Franchisors avoid liability |
| Immigration | Vulnerable workers afraid to complain |

### Modern Era (2000-Present)

**Bush Administration (2001-2008)**

| Policy | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Continued staff decline | Investigators fell to 731 by 2008 |
| White collar exemption changes (2004) | Millions lost overtime eligibility |
| Complaint-driven model | Reduced proactive investigations |
| Immigration enforcement | ICE raids chilled worker complaints |

**Obama Administration (2009-2016)**

| Policy | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Increased enforcement | More investigators, more targeted enforcement |
| Misclassification initiative | Multi-agency approach to worker classification |
| Overtime rule expansion (2016) | Blocked by courts |
| Joint employer guidance | Expanded liability for franchisors |

**Trump Administration (2017-2020)**

| Policy | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Rollback of Obama rules | Joint employer, overtime, classification |
| Immigration enforcement | Chilling effect on complaints |
| Business-friendly DOL | Reduced enforcement |
| Pandemic response | Minimal enforcement during COVID |

**Biden Administration (2021-Present)**

| Policy | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Increased WHD funding | Additional investigators |
| New overtime rule (2024) | Expanding coverage |
| ABC test adoption | Stricter classification standards |
| Enforcement priorities | Focus on high-violation industries |

## Lessons from the Past

### What Worked

**Periods of Effective Enforcement**

| Era | Elements | Outcomes |
|-----|----------|----------|
| 1960s-1970s | Adequate staffing, proactive enforcement | Higher compliance rates |
| Early Obama | Targeted investigations, media attention | Increased recovery |
| State innovations | California, New York strong enforcement | Local improvement |

**Key Success Factors**

1. **Adequate staffing**: More investigators means more deterrence
2. **Proactive enforcement**: Not just waiting for complaints
3. **Meaningful penalties**: Deterrence requires real consequences
4. **Political will**: Enforcement reflects policy priorities
5. **Worker organization**: Unions and worker centers improve compliance

### What Failed

**Chronic Problems**

| Problem | Cause | Result |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Underfunding | Budget cuts | Inadequate enforcement |
| Weak penalties | Business lobbying | No deterrence |
| Exclusions | Political compromise | Millions unprotected |
| Retaliation | Weak protections | Workers afraid to complain |
| Immigration politics | Conflicting enforcement | Vulnerable workers exploited |

**Structural Failures**

1. **Complaint-driven model**: Most victims don't complain
2. **Civil-only enforcement**: Employers face no criminal risk
3. **Minimal penalties**: Violations are cost of doing business
4. **Slow process**: Resolution takes years
5. **Fissured workplace**: Responsibility diffused across entities

### Historical Patterns

**Enforcement Correlates with Political Power**

| Era | Labor Power | Enforcement | Wage Theft |
|-----|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 1938-1980 | High union density | Strong | Lower |
| 1980-2000 | Declining unions | Weakening | Rising |
| 2000-present | Low union density | Weak | Epidemic |

Wage theft enforcement has tracked the decline of organized labor's political power.

**Economic Downturns Increase Violations**

| Period | Conditions | Effect |
|--------|------------|--------|
| 1930s Depression | Mass unemployment | Rampant exploitation pre-FLSA |
| 1981-82 recession | Unemployment spike | Increased violations |
| 2008-09 recession | Job scarcity | Workers accept violations |
| 2020 pandemic | Economic chaos | Increased wage theft |

When jobs are scarce, workers have less power to resist violations.

**Business Model Evolution Enables Violations**

| Decade | Business Trend | Wage Theft Impact |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1980s | Temp agencies, outsourcing | Diffused responsibility |
| 1990s | Franchising expansion | Franchisor denial |
| 2000s | Subcontracting norm | Complex employer relationships |
| 2010s | Gig economy | Mass misclassification |
| 2020s | Algorithmic management | New forms of exploitation |

Business models have evolved to externalize labor costs and evade accountability.

## Comparative Historical Context

### U.S. vs. Other Countries

| Country | Wage Theft Approach | Outcome |
|---------|---------------------|---------|
| United States | Minimal enforcement, civil only | Epidemic wage theft |
| Australia | Strong enforcement, penalties | Lower violation rates |
| UK | HMRC enforcement, naming and shaming | Mixed results |
| France | Labor inspectorate, criminal penalties | Lower rates |
| Germany | Works councils, sectoral bargaining | Minimal theft |
| Nordic countries | Strong unions, collective agreements | Very low rates |

Countries with strong unions and/or robust enforcement have far less wage theft than the U.S.

### Historical Wage Theft in U.S.

| Era | Common Violations | Enforcement |
|-----|-------------------|-------------|
| 1880-1930 | Company stores, scrip payment, child labor | Minimal |
| 1938-1980 | Overtime, minimum wage | Growing enforcement |
| 1980-2000 | Overtime, classification | Declining enforcement |
| 2000-present | All forms, gig economy | Minimal enforcement |

The current wage theft crisis represents a return to pre-New Deal levels of worker exploitation, enabled by the dismantling of enforcement capacity.

## Key Historical Takeaways

1. **FLSA was compromise**: Original exclusions still affect coverage
2. **Enforcement peaked in 1980**: Staffing has never recovered
3. **Reagan cuts were pivotal**: 30%+ reduction transformed enforcement
4. **Courts have narrowed protections**: Exemptions interpreted broadly
5. **Business models evolved**: Fissured workplace diffuses responsibility
6. **Political power matters**: Enforcement tracks labor's political strength
7. **International models exist**: Other countries have lower wage theft
8. **Crisis is reversible**: With political will, enforcement can be rebuilt
