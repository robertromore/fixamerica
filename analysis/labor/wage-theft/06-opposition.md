# Wage Theft: Opposition to Reform

## Who Opposes Stronger Enforcement

Efforts to address wage theft face organized, well-funded opposition from employer groups and their political allies. Understanding this opposition is essential for developing effective reform strategies.

## Business Community Opposition

### National Restaurant Association

**Profile**
- Represents 500,000+ restaurants
- Annual revenue of member companies: $800+ billion
- Political spending: $3-5 million per election cycle
- Lobbying: $3-4 million annually

**Key Positions**

| Issue | NRA Position | Stated Rationale |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| Minimum wage increase | Oppose | "Job killer" |
| Tip credit elimination | Strongly oppose | "Would destroy industry" |
| Joint employer rules | Oppose | Franchise model |
| WHD enforcement funding | Oppose increases | "Regulatory burden" |
| Class actions | Support restrictions | "Lawsuit abuse" |
| Overtime rule expansion | Oppose | "Inflexible" |

**Tactics**
- Campaign contributions to both parties
- Grassroots lobbying through franchisees
- Media campaigns about small business impact
- Model legislation through ALEC
- Coalition building with other business groups

**Why They Oppose**
Restaurant industry has among highest wage theft rates. Strong enforcement would fundamentally change business model for many operators.

### U.S. Chamber of Commerce

**Profile**
- Largest business federation in U.S.
- 3 million member businesses

| Joint employer | Oppose | "Kill franchise model" |
| Mandatory arbitration | Strongly support | "Efficiency" |
| Class action waivers | Strongly support | "Prevent abuse" |
| ABC test | Oppose | "Destroy flexibility" |

**Tactics**
- Massive lobbying operation
- Litigation challenging rules
- Political advertising
- Academic funding
- Media campaigns
- Coalition leadership

**Why They Oppose**
Chamber represents broad business interests. Wage theft enforcement raises costs, increases litigation risk, and empowers workers.

### International Franchise Association

**Profile**
- Represents 1,400 franchise brands
- 750,000+ franchise establishments
- $800+ billion economic output

**Key Positions**

| Wage theft liability | Oppose franchisor liability | "Franchisees are independent" |
| Classification | Oppose ABC test | Protect franchise model |

**Tactics**
- Heavy lobbying on joint employer
- Coalition with Chamber
- Public relations campaigns
- Litigation challenging rules

**Why They Oppose**
Franchise model depends on franchisors controlling conditions without liability. Joint employer rules would fundamentally change accountability.

### National Retail Federation

**Profile**
- Represents retail industry
- Members include major retailers
- Political spending: $5+ million per cycle

**Key Positions**

| Issue | NRF Position |
|-------|--------------|
| Minimum wage | Oppose increases |
| Overtime | Oppose expansion |
| Scheduling laws | Oppose |
| Class actions | Support restrictions |

**Why They Oppose**
Retail has significant wage theft, especially off-the-clock work. Enforcement would require operational changes and cost increases.

### Gig Economy Companies

**Major Players**: Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart

**Profile**
- Combined market cap: $100+ billion
- Workers: 10+ million
- Business model depends on independent contractor classification

**Political Spending**

|----------|--------|---------|
| California Prop 22 (2020) | $205 million | Exempt from AB5 |
| Massachusetts (2022) | $20+ million | Similar exemption |

**Why They Oppose**
Gig business models are built on misclassification. Employee classification would require minimum wage, overtime, benefits, taxes - fundamentally changing economics.

### Construction Industry Associations

- National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)

**Split in Industry**
