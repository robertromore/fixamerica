# Wage Theft: Current State

## The Problem Today

### Magnitude of Wage Theft

**National Estimates**

| Source | Estimated Annual Wage Theft |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Economic Policy Institute | $15 billion (minimum wage violations only) |
| Department of Labor (derived) | $19 billion (all forms, conservative) |
| Academic studies | $40-50 billion (comprehensive) |
| Worker surveys | Likely higher due to underreporting |

The true figure is unknowable because:
- Most violations go undetected
- Many workers don't know they're being cheated
- Undocumented workers rarely report
- No comprehensive tracking system exists

**Comparison to Other Theft**

| Crime | Annual Losses |
|-------|---------------|
| Wage theft | $15-50 billion |
| All property crimes combined | $14 billion |
| Robbery | $482 million |
| Burglary | $3.4 billion |
| Motor vehicle theft | $7.4 billion |
| Larceny-theft | $6.4 billion |

Wage theft steals more than all traditional property crimes combined, yet receives a fraction of enforcement resources.

**By Race/Ethnicity**

| Group | Minimum Wage Violation Rate |
|-------|----------------------------|
| Latino workers | 26% |

| 2016 | 1,000 | +37% |
| 2020 | 780 | -22% |
| 2023 | ~750 | -4% |

The current ratio is approximately one investigator for every 175,000 employers.

**Enforcement Statistics (2023)**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Investigations completed | ~21,000 |
| Back wages collected | $225 million |

| Workers receiving back wages | 175,000 |
| Employers found in violation | ~72% |
| Average back wages per violation | $1,300 |

**Enforcement Gap**

| Metric | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Total employers | 10.5 million |
| Employers investigated annually | ~18,000 |
| Percentage investigated | 0.17% |
| Years between inspections (average) | 588 years |

| DOL complaint (not investigated) | 0% |
| Private lawsuit (filed) | 30-50% recover something |
| Class action (certified) | Higher but rare |
| Overall recovery (all victims) | ~15% of stolen wages |

Only about 15% of stolen wages are ever recovered through all enforcement channels combined.
