# Wage Theft: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

Effective solutions to wage theft must:

1. **Change the calculus**: Make violations unprofitable
2. **Increase detection**: Find violations without waiting for complaints
3. **Empower workers**: Give workers power to protect themselves
4. **Close loopholes**: Address all forms of wage theft
5. **Ensure recovery**: Victims should actually get their money
6. **Prevent retaliation**: Workers must be safe to come forward
7. **Create accountability**: Someone must be responsible

## Enforcement Solutions

### Dramatically Increase Enforcement Staffing

**Current vs. Needed**

| Metric | Current | Proposed |
|--------|---------|----------|
| WHD investigators | ~750 | 3,000-5,000 |
| Employers per investigator | 175,000 | 2,000-3,500 |

| Annual investigations | 21,000 | 100,000+ |

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**

| Investment | Return |
|------------|--------|
| Triple WHD budget ($840M) | $1+ billion additional recovery |
