# Wage Theft: Actions

## What Workers Can Do

### Protect Yourself

**Know Your Rights**

| Right | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| Minimum wage | You must be paid at least federal ($7.25) or state/local minimum |
| Overtime | Time-and-a-half for hours over 40 in a workweek (most workers) |
| Tips are yours | Employers cannot take your tips (with limited tip pool exceptions) |
| Pay for all hours | You must be paid for all time you work |
| Regular payday | Employers must pay on regular schedule |
| Anti-retaliation | Cannot be fired for asserting rights |

**Document Everything**

| What to Track | How |
|---------------|-----|
| Hours worked | Personal log, photos of time clock |
| Pay received | Keep all pay stubs |
| Communications | Save texts, emails about work |
| Witnesses | Note coworkers who saw issues |
| Job duties | Record actual responsibilities |

**Sample Documentation**

```
Week of [Date]
Monday: Arrived 8:15, clocked in 8:30, left 5:45, clocked out 5:30
       [15 minutes pre-shift + 15 minutes post-shift unpaid]
Tuesday: ...
Total unpaid time this week: 2.5 hours
At my rate of $15/hour: $37.50 stolen
```

### Calculate What You're Owed

**Minimum Wage Calculation**

```
Step 1: Total hours worked in week
Step 2: Total gross pay received
Step 3: Divide pay by hours = actual hourly rate
Step 4: Compare to applicable minimum wage
Step 5: If actual rate < minimum, you're owed the difference
```

**Overtime Calculation**

```
Step 1: Identify hours over 40 in workweek
Step 2: Calculate regular rate (total compensation / total hours)
Step 3: Overtime rate = regular rate x 1.5
Step 4: Amount owed = overtime hours x overtime rate
Step 5: Subtract what was paid for those hours
```

**Tip Credit Calculation** (for tipped workers)

```
Step 1: Calculate hourly cash wage received
Step 2: Add tips received
Step 3: If cash wage + tips < minimum wage, employer owes difference
Step 4: If employer took tips, calculate amount taken
```

### Filing a Complaint
