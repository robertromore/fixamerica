# Wage Theft: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Effective wage theft enforcement requires comprehensive legislative reform at federal, state, and local levels. Current law is inadequate: penalties are too weak, enforcement resources are too limited, and loopholes allow widespread violations. This document provides draft legislation addressing these failures, along with analysis of potential weaknesses.

## Constitutional Considerations

### Commerce Clause Authority

Congress has clear authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate wages and hours affecting interstate commerce:

| Case | Holding |
|------|---------|
| *NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel* (1937) | Upheld Commerce Clause regulation of labor |
| *United States v. Darby* (1941) | Upheld FLSA constitutionality |
| *Garcia v. San Antonio Metro Transit* (1985) | FLSA applies to state/local governments |

### Due Process

Wage theft penalties must satisfy due process requirements:

| Requirement | Application |
|-------------|-------------|
| Notice | Clear standards for compliance |
| Proportionality | Penalties proportional to violation |
| Hearing | Opportunity to contest charges |

### Takings Clause

Back wage orders and penalties do not constitute takings because they recover wages already owed.

## Federal Legislation

### Wage Theft Prevention and Recovery Act

**Purpose**: Comprehensive reform of FLSA enforcement, penalties, and worker protections.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Wage Theft Prevention and Recovery
Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that:
    (1) Wage theft costs American workers $15-50 billion annually;
    (2) Current enforcement is inadequate, with fewer than 750
        investigators for over 10 million employers;
    (3) Penalties for wage theft fail to deter violations;
    (4) Workers who file complaints face retaliation;
    (5) Mandatory arbitration and class action waivers prevent
        workers from recovering stolen wages;
    (6) Immigrant workers face particular vulnerability due to
        threats of immigration enforcement;
    (7) Wage theft disproportionately affects low-wage workers,
        workers of color, and women.

SEC. 3. ENHANCED PENALTIES.

(a) CIVIL PENALTIES.—Section 16 of the Fair Labor Standards Act
    (29 U.S.C. 216) is amended by adding:

                related to immigration status;
            (D) 100 percent where the employer has retaliated
                against an employee for asserting rights under
                this Act.

        (3) PENALTY FUND.—Penalties collected under this

## Regulatory Framework

### DOL Rulemaking Priorities

**Worker Classification**

| Element | Proposed Rule |
|---------|---------------|
| Test | ABC test presumption |
| Burden | On employer to prove contractor status |
| Joint employer | Comprehensive definition |
| Guidance | Industry-specific examples |

**Overtime**

| Element | Proposed Rule |
|---------|---------------|
| Salary threshold | 40th percentile of weekly earnings |
| Automatic updates | Annual adjustment |
| Duties test | 50% primary duty requirement |

**Tips**

| Element | Proposed Rule |
|---------|---------------|
| Tip ownership | Employee property |
| Tip pools | Exclude all management |
| Tip credit | Enhanced compliance requirements |

## Legal Considerations

### Preemption Issues

| State Law | Preemption Status |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Higher minimum wage | Not preempted |
| Enhanced penalties | Not preempted |
| Private AG suits | Not preempted |
| Additional causes of action | Generally not preempted |
| Classification rules | Complex, varies |

### Constitutional Challenges

| Potential Challenge | Defense |
|--------------------|---------|
| Commerce Clause limits | Extensive precedent supporting |
| Due process | Clear standards, proportional penalties |
| Excessive fines | Proportional to harm |
| Takings | Recovery of wages owed |

### Enforcement Coordination

| Level | Role |
|-------|------|
| Federal | National standards, large employers |
| State | State law enforcement, state claims |
| Local | Local ordinances, community engagement |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Corporate dissolution | Employer dissolves to avoid liability | High |
| Asset transfers | Assets moved before judgment | High |
| Successor avoidance | New entity avoids predecessor liability | High |
| Small employer exemptions | Very small employers exempt | Medium |
| Classification gaming | New contractor arrangements | High |
| Manager inflation | Reclassify workers as managers | Medium |
| Jurisdictional escape | Operations moved to avoid enforcement | Medium |
| Statute of limitations | Violations discovered too late | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Enforcement capacity limits | Even with increases, can't investigate all | Resource constraints |
| Criminal prosecution rare | Culture of civil-only enforcement | Prosecutorial discretion |
| Retaliation chilling | Workers still fear consequences | Power imbalance |
| Immigrant worker vulnerability | Immigration fears override | Immigration enforcement |
| Arbitration entrenchment | Pre-existing clauses | Contract law |
| Court interpretation | Conservative courts may narrow | Judicial composition |
| Business model adaptation | New arrangements to evade | Adversarial system |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Corporate dissolution protection**:
   - Personal liability for corporate officers
   - Wage bonds required for industries with high violation rates
   - Priority for wage claims in bankruptcy
   - Successor liability provisions

2. **Asset transfer prevention**:
   - Fraudulent transfer provisions specific to wage claims
   - Expedited enforcement procedures
   - Preliminary liens on employer assets

3. **Classification gaming**:
   - Strong ABC test with employer burden
   - Industry-specific guidance
   - Rapid response investigations for new arrangements
   - Anti-circumvention provisions

4. **Retaliation protection enhancement**:
   - Preliminary reinstatement orders
   - Enhanced damages for retaliation
   - Immigration enforcement firewall
   - Anonymous complaint procedures

5. **Immigrant worker protection**:
   - Statutory bar on immigration enforcement during wage claims
   - U-visa availability for wage theft victims
   - Confidentiality requirements
   - Enhanced penalties for immigration-related threats

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Agency capture | Civil service protections, inspector general oversight |
| Political reversibility | Statutory protections, not just rules |
| State variation | Federal floor with state ability to exceed |
| Business adaptation | Adaptive enforcement authority |
| Funding instability | Dedicated penalty fund |

### Monitoring and Evaluation

| Metric | Frequency | Responsible Entity |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| Violation rates | Annual | DOL, academic researchers |
| Recovery rates | Annual | DOL, state agencies |
| Complaint volumes | Quarterly | DOL, states |
| Enforcement actions | Quarterly | DOL |
| Criminal prosecutions | Annual | DOJ |

### Amendment Procedures

1. **Regular review**: GAO evaluation every 5 years
2. **Regulatory authority**: Agency authority to address emerging loopholes
3. **Anti-circumvention**: General provision prohibiting arrangements designed to evade
4. **Sunset review**: Major provisions reviewed before sunset
