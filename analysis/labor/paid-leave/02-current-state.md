The only federal leave protection remains the FMLA, which provides unpaid leave.

| Hispanic workers | 47% |
| Workers without high school diploma | 54% |
| Part-time workers | 59% |
| Workers earning below $15/hour | 49% |

### No Federal Paid Sick Leave

The United States has no federal law requiring paid sick leave for private sector workers.

| Families First Coronavirus Response Act | March 2020 |
