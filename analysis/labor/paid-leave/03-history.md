# Paid Leave: History

## Early Leave Movements

### Origins of Maternity Leave

**International Beginnings**

| Year | Country | Development |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1883 | Germany | First maternity leave under Bismarck's social insurance |
| 1891 | Germany | Mandatory maternity leave (3 weeks) |
| 1911 | United Kingdom | National Insurance Act includes maternity benefit |
| 1919 | ILO | Maternity Protection Convention adopted |
| 1921 | Eight countries | Ratify ILO convention (not U.S.) |

**U.S. Progressive Era**

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1912 | Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive Party platform calls for maternity benefits |
| 1919 | First state maternity leave bill introduced (failed) |
| 1921 | Sheppard-Towner Act (maternal/infant health grants, not leave) |
| 1929 | Sheppard-Towner allowed to expire |

### New Deal and Social Security

**Social Security Act of 1935**

Established unemployment insurance and old-age benefits but explicitly excluded:

| Excluded Coverage | Reason Given |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Maternity benefits | Administrative difficulty |
| Temporary disability | State-level concern |
| Domestic workers | Southern Democrats' insistence |
| Agricultural workers | Southern Democrats' insistence |

**Railroad Employees (1946)**

| Development | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act | First federal temporary disability insurance |
| Coverage | Railroad workers only |
| Significance | Precedent for disability insurance model |

### Post-War State Programs

**California Temporary Disability Insurance (1946)**

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Established | 1946, first state program |
| Coverage | Temporary disability including pregnancy |
| Funding | Employee payroll tax |
| Significance | Model for other states |

**Other State TDI Programs**

| State | Year Established |
|-------|------------------|
| Rhode Island | 1942 |
| California | 1946 |
| New Jersey | 1948 |
| New York | 1949 |
| Hawaii | 1969 |
| Puerto Rico | 1968 |

## The Women's Movement and Pregnancy Discrimination

### 1960s-1970s: Pregnancy as Disability?

**Key Court Cases**

| Case | Year | Outcome |
|------|------|---------|
| *Geduldig v. Aiello* | 1974 | Pregnancy exclusion from disability insurance not sex discrimination |
| *General Electric v. Gilbert* | 1976 | Pregnancy discrimination not covered by Title VII |

**The Problem**

- Women could be fired for being pregnant
- Pregnancy excluded from disability coverage
- No job protection for childbirth
- Forced to choose between career and family

### Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978

**Response to Gilbert**

Congress overturned the Supreme Court decision with the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.

| Provision | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Amends Title VII | Pregnancy discrimination = sex discrimination |
| Coverage | Employers with 15+ employees |
| Requirement | Treat pregnancy like other temporary disabilities |
| Leave requirement | None - only equal treatment |
| Job protection | Only if offered for other disabilities |

**Limitations**

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| No mandated leave | Employers not required to offer any leave |
| Small employer exemption | Millions uncovered |
| Equal treatment standard | Only as good as worst disability policy |
| No pay requirement | Unpaid leave if leave offered |

| 1990s | Accept compromise to pass anything |
| 2000s | State-by-state, starting with progressive states |
| 2010s | Local ordinances (sick leave), state programs (family leave) |
| 2020s | Build state momentum, attempt federal action |
