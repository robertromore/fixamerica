# Paid Leave: Solutions

## Overview

Comprehensive paid leave reform requires action at multiple levels: federal legislation to establish a national floor, state programs to fill gaps and innovate, employer practices to exceed minimums, and cultural change to normalize leave-taking. This chapter outlines policy solutions across these dimensions.

## Federal Solutions

### Comprehensive National Paid Family and Medical Leave

**FAMILY Act Model (Social Insurance)**

The most comprehensive proposal is a national social insurance program modeled on successful state programs.

| Feature | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Duration | 12 weeks family + 12 weeks medical |
| Wage replacement | Progressive: 90% for low wage, 66% average |
| Maximum benefit | 100% of state average weekly wage |
| Funding | 0.4% payroll tax (shared employer/employee) |
| Administration | Social Security Administration |
| Coverage | All workers, including self-employed opt-in |

**Why Social Insurance?**

| Advantage | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| Universal pool | Spreads risk, reduces cost |
| Employer relief | Not bearing full cost |
| Portability | Not tied to specific employer |
| Administrative efficiency | Federal infrastructure exists |
| Proven model | State programs demonstrate success |

**Key Design Elements**

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Job protection | Concurrent with FMLA expansion |
| Qualifying reasons | Childbirth, adoption, foster, illness, caregiving, military |
| Family definition | Inclusive - chosen family, domestic partners |
| Self-employed | Opt-in with equivalent contribution |
| Waiting period | Minimal (0-7 days for family, 7 days for medical) |

### Federal Paid Sick Leave

**Healthy Families Act Model**

| Feature | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Accrual | 1 hour per 30 hours worked |
| Maximum accrual | 56 hours (7 days) per year |
| Covered employers | All employers |
| Uses | Personal illness, family care, preventive care, domestic violence |
| Carryover | Yes, up to cap |
| No retaliation | Strong protections |

**Why Paid Sick Leave Is Different**

| Factor | Paid Sick Leave | Paid Family Leave |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Duration | Days | Weeks/months |
| Funding | Typically employer | Social insurance |
| Frequency | Common events | Less frequent |
| Administration | Employer | State/federal agency |

### FMLA Expansion

**Current Gaps to Fix**

| Gap | Solution |
|-----|----------|
| 50 employee threshold | Cover all employers |
| 12 month/1,250 hours | Reduce to 60 days, 500 hours |
| 75-mile rule | Eliminate geographic limit |
| Family definition | Expand to include grandparents, siblings, chosen family |
| Serious health condition | Clarify to include mental health |

**Enhanced FMLA**

| Feature | Current | Proposed |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Employer size | 50+ employees | All employers |
| Tenure requirement | 12 months | 90 days |
| Hours requirement | 1,250 hours | 500 hours |
| Family definition | Narrow | Inclusive |
| Duration | 12 weeks | 12 weeks (with paid program) |

### Alternative Federal Approaches

**Tax Credit Approaches (Republican Proposals)**

| Approach | Design | Limitations |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Employer tax credit | Credit for providing leave | Voluntary; workers still lack guarantee |
| Worker tax credit | Credit against payroll | Does not require time off |
| Advance of tax credit | Draw against future returns | Creates debt for workers |

**Why Tax Credits Are Insufficient**

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Voluntary | Employers not required to participate |
| No guarantee | Workers still cannot count on leave |
| Timing | Credits come after leave needed |
| Inadequate | Does not replace lost wages |

**Universal Basic Services Approach**

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Concept | Paid leave as part of broader safety net |
| Funding | General revenue |
| Advantage | Not regressive payroll tax |
| Challenge | Political difficulty of general revenue funding |
