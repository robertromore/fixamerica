# Paid Leave: Overview

The United States stands alone among developed nations in failing to guarantee paid family and medical leave or paid sick leave. An estimated 44 million American workers lack access to paid sick days, and approximately 79% of workers in the private sector have no access to paid family leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), passed in 1993, provides only unpaid leave, covers only 60% of workers, and offers just 12 weeks for qualifying life events. Workers who cannot afford to take unpaid time off face impossible choices between their health, their families, and their economic survival.
