# Paid Leave: Overview

## Executive Summary

The United States stands alone among developed nations in failing to guarantee paid family and medical leave or paid sick leave. An estimated 44 million American workers lack access to paid sick days, and approximately 79% of workers in the private sector have no access to paid family leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), passed in 1993, provides only unpaid leave, covers only 60% of workers, and offers just 12 weeks for qualifying life events. Workers who cannot afford to take unpaid time off face impossible choices between their health, their families, and their economic survival.

The consequences of this policy failure cascade across American society. Workers return to jobs too soon after childbirth, surgery, or illness. Parents miss crucial bonding time with newborns. Caregivers deplete savings to care for sick family members. Women disproportionately bear the burden, dropping out of the workforce or reducing hours, contributing to the gender wage gap and reducing lifetime earnings. Small businesses struggle to compete with large corporations that can afford to offer leave benefits.

A comprehensive paid leave system would strengthen families, improve health outcomes, increase women's workforce participation, reduce poverty, and bring the United States in line with every other wealthy nation on earth.

## The Core Problem

### America's Paid Leave Desert

The United States is the only OECD country that does not guarantee paid maternity leave. Among 193 countries in the United Nations, only six do not mandate paid maternity leave: the United States, Papua New Guinea, and four small Pacific island nations.

| Country | Paid Maternity Leave | Paid Paternity Leave | Paid Sick Leave |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| United States | 0 weeks | 0 weeks | 0 days |
| Canada | 15-18 weeks | 5 weeks | Varies by province |
| United Kingdom | 39 weeks | 2 weeks | 28 weeks |
| Germany | 14 weeks | 0 (but parental leave) | 78 weeks |
| France | 16 weeks | 28 days | Until recovery |
| Japan | 14 weeks | 52 weeks (shared) | Employer-provided |
| Australia | 18 weeks | 2 weeks | 10 days |
| OECD Average | 18 weeks | 8 weeks | Varies |

### What American Workers Face

**Access to Paid Family Leave (Private Sector)**

| Worker Category | Access to Paid Family Leave |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| All private sector workers | 27% |
| Lowest wage quartile | 8% |
| Highest wage quartile | 43% |
| Part-time workers | 12% |
| Full-time workers | 31% |
| Union workers | 41% |
| Non-union workers | 25% |

**Access to Paid Sick Leave**

| Worker Category | Access to Paid Sick Leave |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| All private sector workers | 79% |
| Lowest wage quartile | 57% |
| Highest wage quartile | 95% |
| Service occupations | 64% |
| Management/professional | 92% |

### FMLA: The Unpaid Compromise

The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 was a significant achievement but left major gaps:

| FMLA Feature | Limitation |
|--------------|------------|
| Duration | 12 weeks only |
| Coverage | ~60% of workers (employer size, tenure requirements) |
| Compensation | Unpaid - workers must use accrued PTO |
| Eligibility | 12 months, 1,250 hours with same employer |
| Employer size | Only employers with 50+ employees within 75 miles |
| Reason for leave | Narrow qualifying events |
| Job protection | Yes, but not enforceable for many |

**Who FMLA Excludes**

| Excluded Workers | Approximate Number |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Workers at small employers | 40+ million |
| Workers with insufficient tenure | Variable |
| Part-time workers below hour threshold | Millions |
| Workers without qualifying family member | Variable |
| Total unprotected workers | ~40% of workforce |

## By the Numbers

### The Leave Gap

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Workers without paid sick leave | 33.6 million |
| Workers without paid family leave | 100+ million |
| Americans needing leave in a year | 1 in 5 workers |
| Workers who cannot afford unpaid FMLA | 46% of those eligible |
| Leave takers who go into debt | 20% |

### Economic Impact

| Impact | Measure |
|--------|---------|
| Lost wages from unpaid FMLA | $20.6 billion annually |
| Women leaving workforce for caregiving | 2.1 million annually |
| Cost to employers of turnover (replacement) | 50-200% of salary |
| Healthcare savings from paid leave | Reduced readmissions |

### Health Outcomes

| Outcome | Impact of Paid Leave |
|---------|---------------------|
| Infant mortality | 10% reduction per 10 weeks of leave |
| Breastfeeding rates | 2x more likely to breastfeed 6+ months |
| Postpartum depression | 50% reduction risk |
| Premature return to work | Major cause of complications |

## Key Concepts

### Types of Leave

| Leave Type | Purpose | Duration |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Parental leave | Bonding with new child | 12+ weeks typical |
| Family caregiving leave | Care for ill family member | As needed |
| Medical leave | Worker's own serious health condition | As needed |
| Sick leave | Minor illness, medical appointments | 1-10 days typically |
| Bereavement leave | Death of family member | 3-5 days typically |

### Funding Models

| Model | How It Works | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Social insurance (payroll tax) | Employer/employee contributions | State programs |
| Employer mandate | Employer provides directly | Some sick leave laws |
| General revenue | Taxpayer funded | Some proposals |
| Tax credits | Incentive for employer provision | SECURE Act |

### Wage Replacement

| Program | Wage Replacement Rate |
|---------|----------------------|
| California | 60-70% (up to cap) |
| New York | 67% (up to cap) |
| New Jersey | 85% (up to cap) |
| Washington | 90% (up to cap) for low wage |
| European average | 70-100% |

```

### Who Has Access vs. Who Needs It Most

| Factor | Access | Need |
|--------|--------|------|
| Income | High income = more access | Low income = more need |
| Education | College+ = more access | Less education = more need |
| Occupation | Professional = more access | Service = more need |
| Employment type | Full-time = more access | Part-time = more need |
| Firm size | Large employer = more access | Small employer workers = more need |
