# Infrastructure Finance: Overview

## Executive Summary

America's infrastructure investment gap—the difference between what we spend and what we need—exceeds $2 trillion over the next decade. Closing this gap requires reforming how we pay for infrastructure: fixing trust funds running deficits, developing new revenue sources as fuel taxes decline, leveraging private investment where appropriate, and ensuring equitable distribution of costs and benefits. This document examines how infrastructure is currently financed, why the system is failing, and pathways to sustainable funding.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Federal infrastructure funding**: Trust funds, appropriations, grants
- **State and local finance**: Taxes, bonds, user fees
- **User fees and taxes**: Gas tax, tolls, utility rates
- **Public-private partnerships**: P3 structures and limitations
- **Infrastructure banks**: National and state models
- **Innovative finance**: Value capture, green bonds, TIFIA
- **Equity considerations**: Who pays, who benefits
