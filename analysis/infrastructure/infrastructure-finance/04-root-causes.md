# Infrastructure Finance: Root Causes

## Overview

America's infrastructure funding gap stems from political, structural, and technological factors. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing sustainable funding solutions.

## Revenue Erosion

### Fuel Tax Decline

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **No increase since 1993** | Lost 47% to inflation |
| **Improved fuel efficiency** | Less revenue per mile |
| **Electric vehicles** | Zero fuel tax paid |
| **Alternative fuels** | Often taxed less |

### Purchasing Power Loss

| Year | Nominal Rate | Real Value (2024) |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| **1993** | 18.4¢ | 38.4¢ |
| **2000** | 18.4¢ | 32.7¢ |
| **2010** | 18.4¢ | 25.8¢ |
| **2020** | 18.4¢ | 21.3¢ |
| **2024** | 18.4¢ | 18.4¢ |

### EV Impact Projections

| Year | EV Share | Fuel Tax Loss |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **2025** | 10-15% | $5+ billion |
| **2030** | 25-35% | $15+ billion |
| **2040** | 50-65% | $30+ billion |
| **2050** | 75%+ | Near total erosion |

## Political Barriers

### Anti-Tax Environment

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Pledges** | Politicians commit to no tax increases |
| **Primary politics** | Tax increases punished in primaries |
| **Visibility** | Gas tax highly visible |
| **Alternatives** | General fund transfers politically easier |

### Short-Term Focus

| Dynamic | Result |
|---------|--------|
| **Election cycles** | 2-4 year horizons |
| **Immediate priorities** | Current services beat future infrastructure |
| **Deficit concerns** | Long-term needs deferred |
| **Credit claiming** | Prefer new projects to maintenance |

### Geographic Politics

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Donor vs. donee states** | Fights over formula allocation |
| **Urban vs. rural** | Transit vs. highway conflicts |
| **Red vs. blue states** | Partisan infrastructure preferences |
| **Project earmarks** | Political allocation |

## Structural Problems

### Trust Fund Design

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Revenue tied to gallons** | Not to system use or costs |
| **No indexing** | Purchasing power erodes |
| **Spending obligations** | Committed regardless of revenue |
| **General fund dependence** | Unsustainable transfers |

### Intergovernmental Complexity

| Level | Challenge |
|-------|-----------|
| **Federal** | Revenue collected but not sufficient |
| **State** | Own taxes, federal dependence |
| **Local** | Limited revenue options |
| **Metropolitan** | Fragmented decision-making |

### Budget Scoring

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Leasing favored** | Short-term cost appearance |
| **Ownership penalized** | Full cost scored upfront |
| **P3 scoring** | Complexity and inconsistency |
| **Long-term costs** | Not fully captured |

## User Fee Challenges

### Tolling Limitations

| Barrier | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Federal restrictions** | Interstate tolling limited |
| **Political opposition** | "Double taxation" argument |
| **Equity concerns** | Regressive impact |
| **Diversion** | Traffic shifts to free roads |

### VMT Fee Barriers

| Barrier | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Privacy concerns** | Tracking fears |
| **Technology** | Collection systems needed |
| **Transition** | How to shift from gas tax |
| **Multi-state** | Interstate coordination |

### Water Pricing

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Rate resistance** | Political sensitivity |
| **Affordability** | Low-income impacts |
| **Deferred maintenance** | Rates set below cost |
| **Fragmentation** | 50,000+ water systems |

## Investment Misallocation

### New vs. Maintenance

| Bias | Cause |
|------|-------|
| **New construction** | More visible, political credit |
| **Maintenance neglected** | Less visible, deferred |
| **Result** | Growing deferred maintenance backlog |

### Geographic Allocation

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Formula politics** | Allocation by politics, not need |
| **All states receive** | Even low-need areas |
| **High-cost areas underfunded** | Urban areas with complex needs |
| **Modal imbalance** | Highway bias over transit, rail |

## Equity Concerns

### Regressive Financing

| Mechanism | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Fuel taxes** | Higher burden on lower incomes |
| **Tolls** | Disproportionate to poor |
| **Utility rates** | Basic necessity costs |
| **Sales taxes** | Regressive |

### Benefit Distribution

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Suburban investment** | Highway focus |
| **Urban disinvestment** | Transit underfunded |
| **Infrastructure racism** | Historic highway destruction |
| **Rural access** | Broadband, transit gaps |

## Private Finance Limitations

### P3 Constraints

| Limitation | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Higher financing cost** | Private borrowing rates |
| **Transaction costs** | Complex procurement |
| **Profit requirement** | Private return extracted |
| **Cherry-picking** | Only viable projects |

### Market Failures

| Failure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Public goods** | Cannot charge for all benefits |
| **Externalities** | Benefits to non-users |
| **Natural monopoly** | Limited competition |
| **Long time horizons** | Private sector time horizon shorter |

## Climate Transition

### Decarbonization Impact

| Transition | Funding Impact |
|------------|----------------|
| **Electric vehicles** | Erode fuel tax base |
| **Reduced driving** | Lower user fee revenue |
| **Mode shift** | Different infrastructure needs |
| **Resilience needs** | New investment requirements |

### Stranded Assets

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Fossil fuel infrastructure** | Declining use |
| **Parking facilities** | Autonomous vehicles |
| **Airport capacity** | Changed travel patterns |
| **Road capacity** | Induced demand concerns |

## Feedback Loops

### Decline Cycle

```
Revenue erosion → Deferred maintenance → Deterioration
       ↑                                      ↓
   Resistance to increases ← Poor service ← User frustration
```

### Political Trap

```
No tax increase → General fund transfers → Deficit concerns
       ↑                                        ↓
   Anti-tax politics ← Spending constraints ← Budget pressure
```

| **Political** | Anti-tax environment, short-term focus |
| **Structural** | Trust fund design, intergovernmental complexity |
| **User fees** | Tolling limits, VMT barriers, pricing resistance |
| **Allocation** | New vs. maintenance bias, geographic politics |
