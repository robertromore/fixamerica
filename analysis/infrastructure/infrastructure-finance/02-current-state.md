# Infrastructure Finance: Current State

## Overview

America's infrastructure financing system relies on a patchwork of federal trust funds, state taxes, local bonds, user fees, and general revenues. The system faces mounting stress as traditional revenue sources erode, investment needs grow, and political resistance to new funding persists.
