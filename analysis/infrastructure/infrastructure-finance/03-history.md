# Infrastructure Finance: History

## Overview

How America finances infrastructure has evolved dramatically—from private investment in early canals and railroads, to federal land grants, to dedicated trust funds, to today's complex mix of user fees, general revenues, and credit programs. Understanding this history illuminates both the possibilities and constraints for reform.
