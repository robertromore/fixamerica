# Ports and Waterways: Current State

## Overview

America's ports and waterways are experiencing unprecedented strain from growing trade volumes, larger vessels, aging infrastructure, and climate impacts. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed supply chain vulnerabilities, while ongoing challenges with lock reliability and port congestion threaten economic competitiveness. Recent federal investment provides opportunity but cannot address decades of deferred maintenance alone.
