# Ports and Waterways: Overview

America's ports and waterways are the backbone of international trade, handling over $2 trillion in goods annually. The nation's 360+ ports, inland waterway system, and maritime infrastructure face aging locks, insufficient capacity, climate vulnerability, and funding challenges. Supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic exposed systemic weaknesses, highlighting the need for strategic investment in this critical but often overlooked infrastructure.
