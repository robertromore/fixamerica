# Ports and Waterways: History

## Overview

America's maritime infrastructure has shaped national development since colonial times. The inland waterway system enabled westward expansion, while seaports connected the nation to global trade. Federal involvement through the Army Corps of Engineers created a national navigation system, but changing economics, containerization, and decades of underinvestment have created today's challenges.
