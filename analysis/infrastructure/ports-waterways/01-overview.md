# Ports and Waterways: Overview

## Executive Summary

America's ports and waterways are the backbone of international trade, handling over $2 trillion in goods annually. The nation's 360+ ports, inland waterway system, and maritime infrastructure face aging locks, insufficient capacity, climate vulnerability, and funding challenges. Supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic exposed systemic weaknesses, highlighting the need for strategic investment in this critical but often overlooked infrastructure.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Seaports**: Container, bulk, cruise terminals
- **Inland waterways**: Rivers, locks, dams
- **Intermodal connections**: Rail, truck links
- **Navigation**: Channels, dredging, aids
- **Harbor infrastructure**: Piers, breakwaters, facilities
- **Climate resilience**: Sea level rise, storms

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Ports** | 360+ | Commercial ports |
| **Trade value** | $2+ trillion | Annual goods movement |
| **Container volume** | 50+ million TEUs | Annual throughput |
| **Inland waterway miles** | 25,000 | Navigable system |
| **Lock chambers** | 240 | USACE operated |
| **Lock age** | Average 60+ years | Many over design life |
| **Infrastructure grade** | D+ (inland), C+ (ports) | ASCE Report Card |

## Scale of the Challenge

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Port capacity** | Strained at major gateways |
| **Lock condition** | Many beyond design life |
| **Channel depth** | Insufficient for modern ships |
| **Intermodal** | Congestion at connections |
| **Resilience** | Climate vulnerability growing |

## Problem Statement

The maritime and waterway system faces critical challenges:

1. **Aging locks**: Many approaching 100 years old
2. **Port congestion**: Capacity below demand
3. **Channel depth**: Inadequate for larger vessels
4. **Intermodal gaps**: Poor rail/truck connections
5. **Funding shortfall**: Below investment needs
6. **Climate risk**: Sea level, storm exposure
7. **Supply chain**: Systemic vulnerabilities

## Root Causes Summary

| Cause | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **Funding structure** | Harbor Maintenance Tax issues |
| **Federal-local split** | Investment coordination |
| **Long project timelines** | Corps of Engineers process |
| **Deferred maintenance** | Decades of underinvestment |
| **Climate neglect** | Resilience underprioritized |

## Solution Directions

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Inland waterway investment** | Lock replacement |
| **Port capacity** | Terminal expansion |
| **Channel deepening** | Accommodate larger ships |
| **Intermodal** | Improve connections |
| **Resilience** | Climate adaptation |
| **Funding reform** | Adequate, predictable revenue |

## Stakeholder Landscape
