# Broadband Infrastructure: Overview

## Executive Summary

High-speed internet access has become essential infrastructure for economic participation, education, healthcare, and civic life. Yet millions of Americans lack adequate broadband, particularly in rural areas and low-income communities. The digital divide perpetuates inequality and limits opportunity. Closing this gap requires sustained public investment, regulatory reform, and competition policy to ensure universal, affordable, reliable broadband access.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Broadband availability**: Network deployment and coverage gaps
- **Affordability**: Cost barriers to access
- **Adoption**: Usage and digital literacy
- **Infrastructure**: Fiber, wireless, satellite technologies
- **Competition**: Market structure and pricing
- **Digital equity**: Disparities by geography, income, race

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Unserved Americans** | 21-42 million | Depending on definition |
| **Rural without broadband** | ~25% of rural areas | Major coverage gaps |
| **Tribal lands unserved** | ~30-35% | Worst connected |
| **Average cost** | $70-80/month | Among highest in developed world |
| **BEAD funding** | $42.5 billion | Historic federal investment |
| **Fiber households** | ~50% have access | Growing but uneven |

## Scale of the Challenge

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Coverage gaps** | Rural, tribal, low-income urban |
| **Speed disparities** | Varying quality of service |
| **Affordability** | Many cannot afford available service |
| **Adoption** | Usage lags availability |
| **Competition** | Most areas have limited choices |

## Problem Statement

America's broadband infrastructure faces multiple challenges:

1. **Coverage gaps**: Millions lack any broadband option
2. **Affordability**: Service costs exclude many
3. **Speed disparities**: Quality varies dramatically
4. **Limited competition**: Most areas are monopoly/duopoly
5. **Digital literacy**: Skills gaps limit adoption
6. **Infrastructure quality**: Aging networks, inadequate capacity
7. **Regulatory capture**: Industry shapes rules

## Root Causes Summary

| Cause | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **Market failure** | Private investment skips unprofitable areas |
| **Natural monopoly** | High infrastructure costs |
| **Regulatory gaps** | Inadequate oversight |
| **Definition problems** | Outdated speed standards |
| **Mapping failures** | Overstate coverage |
| **Subsidy waste** | Poorly targeted programs |

## Solution Directions

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Public investment** | BEAD and other programs |
| **Municipal broadband** | Public option |
| **Competition policy** | Open access, line sharing |
| **Affordability programs** | Subsidies for low-income |
| **Digital equity** | Adoption, literacy programs |
| **Infrastructure sharing** | Reduce duplicate builds |

## Stakeholder Landscape

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|-------------|----------|
| **ISPs (large)** | Subsidy capture, reduced regulation |
| **Small ISPs** | Competitive access |
| **Municipal providers** | Local service authority |
| **Rural communities** | Coverage |
| **Low-income households** | Affordability |
| **Schools/libraries** | Institutional access |
| **Telehealth** | Healthcare delivery |
| **Remote workers** | Reliable connectivity |

## Why This Matters

| Impact | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| **Economic** | Essential for modern economy |
| **Education** | Required for homework, learning |
| **Healthcare** | Telehealth access |
| **Employment** | Job search, remote work |
| **Civic participation** | Democratic engagement |
| **Equity** | Digital divide deepens inequality |
