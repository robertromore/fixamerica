# Broadband Infrastructure: Current State

## Overview

America's broadband landscape is characterized by significant disparities: world-class connectivity in some areas, complete absence in others, and high prices nearly everywhere. Recent federal investment through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act represents the largest broadband commitment in history, but implementation challenges and industry consolidation threaten to perpetuate existing inequities.
