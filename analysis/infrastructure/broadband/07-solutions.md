# Broadband Infrastructure: Solutions

## Overview

Achieving universal, affordable broadband requires public investment in unserved areas, competition policy to reduce prices, affordability programs for low-income households, and regulatory reform to prevent industry abuse. Solutions must address both infrastructure deployment and the economic barriers that prevent adoption even where service exists.
