### Municipal Broadband Freedom Act

**Purpose**: Remove barriers to municipal and cooperative broadband.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Municipal Broadband
Freedom Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
    (1) municipal and cooperative broadband
    networks provide competition and serve
    communities neglected by private providers;
    (2) state laws restricting municipal broadband
    harm consumers and limit competition;

    to meet community connectivity needs;
    (4) federal preemption is necessary to ensure
    local authority.

SEC. 3. PREEMPTION.

(a) STATE LAWS PREEMPTED.—No state or local law
shall prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting
any public entity from providing broadband service.

(b) SCOPE.—This preemption includes laws that—
    (1) directly prohibit public broadband;
    (2) impose onerous procedural requirements;
    (3) restrict financing mechanisms;
    (4) limit service areas; or
    (5) otherwise effectively prevent public
    broadband.

SEC. 4. PRESERVED AUTHORITY.

(a) LOCAL DECISION.—Nothing requires any public
entity to provide broadband.

(b) REASONABLE REGULATION.—States may impose
reasonable, nondiscriminatory requirements
applicable to all providers.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Broadband Competition
Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
    (1) most Americans have limited choice in
    broadband providers;
    (2) lack of competition results in higher
    prices and lower quality;
    (3) promoting competition benefits consumers;
    (4) regulatory action is necessary.

SEC. 3. COMMON CARRIER CLASSIFICATION.

(a) CLASSIFICATION.—Broadband internet access
service is a telecommunications service under
Title II of the Communications Act.

(b) FORBEARANCE.—The FCC may forbear from
applying provisions not necessary to protect
consumers and promote competition.
