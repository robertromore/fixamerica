# Broadband Infrastructure: History

## Overview

American broadband evolved from telephone and cable television networks, shaped by deregulation, competition policy shifts, and technological change. Early promises of universal high-speed access gave way to market-based approaches that left many behind. Understanding this history reveals how current disparities emerged and why reform requires fundamental policy change.

## Dial-Up Era (1990s)

### Internet Emergence

| Development | Year | Impact |
|-------------|------|--------|
| **Commercial internet** | 1991 | Public access begins |
| **World Wide Web** | 1993 | Mass adoption driver |

| **ISP competition** | 1990s | Thousands of dial-up ISPs |

### Telecommunications Act of 1996

| Element | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Line unbundling** | Required access for competitors |
| **Universal service** | Expanded beyond telephone |

| **Cable deregulation** | Reduced rate regulation |

### Early Broadband Promise

| Technology | Status |
|------------|--------|
| **DSL** | Telcos begin offering |
| **Cable modems** | Cable companies enter market |
| **Competition** | Multiple providers in many areas |
| **Universal access rhetoric** | Political commitment (unfulfilled) |

## Broadband Emergence (2000-2005)

### Technology Development

| Development | Year | Impact |
|-------------|------|--------|
| **DSL expansion** | 2000-2005 | Telco broadband grows |

| **DSL deregulated** | 2005 | Unbundling eliminated |
| **Brand X decision** | 2005 | Supreme Court upholds FCC |

### Impact of Deregulation

| Effect | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| **ISP consolidation** | Thousands of ISPs disappear |
| **Competition decline** | Duopoly emerges |
| **Investment shift** | To private decisions |
| **Rural neglect** | Unprofitable areas ignored |

## Consolidation Era (2005-2015)

### Market Concentration

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| **2006** | AT&T acquires BellSouth |
| **2008** | Verizon stops FiOS expansion |
| **2014** | AT&T acquires DirecTV |
| **2015** | Charter acquires Time Warner Cable |

### Net Neutrality Battles

| Event | Year | Outcome |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Comcast/BitTorrent** | 2008 | FCC order struck down |
| **Open Internet Order** | 2010 | Partial rules |
| **Verizon v. FCC** | 2014 | Order struck down |
| **Title II reclassification** | 2015 | Net neutrality established |

### Rural and Urban Divide

| Area | Status (2015) |
|------|---------------|
| **Urban** | Most have options |
| **Suburban** | Cable dominant |
| **Rural** | Major gaps |
| **Tribal** | Severely underserved |

### Stimulus Era (2009)

| Program | Funding |
|---------|---------|
| **Broadband Technology Opportunities Program** | $4.7 billion |
| **Broadband Initiatives Program** | $2.5 billion |
| **Impact** | Modest, flawed mapping |

## Net Neutrality and Competition (2015-2020)

### Obama-Era Regulation

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **Title II classification** | Common carrier rules |
| **Net neutrality** | No blocking, throttling, paid prioritization |
| **Privacy rules** | ISP data restrictions |
| **Competition policy** | Modest efforts |

### Trump-Era Rollback

| Action | Year | Impact |
|--------|------|--------|
| **Net neutrality repeal** | 2017 | Restoring Internet Freedom Order |
| **Privacy rules eliminated** | 2017 | ISP data rules reversed |
| **Deregulatory approach** | 2017-2020 | Industry-friendly FCC |

### Technology Evolution

| Development | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| **Fiber expansion** | Verizon FiOS, AT&T Fiber, others |
| **DOCSIS 3.1** | Cable gigabit speeds |
| **Fixed wireless** | Rural alternative |
| **5G promises** | Marketing exceeds reality |

## Infrastructure Investment Era (2020-Present)

### COVID-19 Impact

| Effect | Response |
|--------|----------|
| **Digital divide exposed** | Remote work/school revealed gaps |
| **Emergency programs** | Temporary funding |
| **Political attention** | Broadband becomes priority |
| **Adoption surge** | Usage increased dramatically |

### Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (2021)

| Element | Funding |
|---------|---------|
| **BEAD** | $42.5 billion |
| **Affordable Connectivity Program** | $14.2 billion |
| **Digital Equity** | $2.75 billion |
| **Middle Mile** | $1 billion |

### Current Challenges

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **BEAD rollout** | Slow, complex |
| **ACP exhausted** | No replacement |
| **Mapping** | Improved but imperfect |
| **Industry consolidation** | Continues |
| **Competition** | Limited |

## Key Historical Patterns

| Pattern | Contemporary Relevance |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Deregulation** | Competition failed to materialize |
| **Subsidy capture** | Industry takes, underdelivers |
