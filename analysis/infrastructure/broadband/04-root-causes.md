# Broadband Infrastructure: Root Causes

## Overview

America's broadband failures result from market structures that create natural monopolies, regulatory capture that serves industry interests, policy choices that prioritized deregulation over universal service, and mapping failures that obscured the true extent of the problem. Addressing these root causes requires understanding how they interact to perpetuate the digital divide.

## Market Structure Failures

### Natural Monopoly Economics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **High fixed costs** | Infrastructure expensive to build |
| **Low marginal costs** | Cheap to add customers once built |
| **Network effects** | Value increases with subscribers |
| **Economies of scale** | Larger providers more efficient |
| **Sunk costs** | Investment difficult to recover |

### Competition Barriers

| Barrier | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Capital requirements** | $1,000+ per home passed |
| **Incumbent advantages** | Existing infrastructure |
| **Pole attachment** | Access to utility poles |
| **Franchise requirements** | Local agreements |
| **Scale economics** | Large providers dominate |

### Rural Market Failure

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Low density** | Few customers per mile |
| **High build costs** | Longer distances |
| **Low revenue** | Lower income areas |
| **No business case** | Private investment won't serve |

## Regulatory Failures

### Deregulation Consequences

| Decision | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| **Information service classification** | Reduced oversight |
| **Unbundling elimination** | Killed DSL competition |
| **Rate deregulation** | Price increases |
| **Privacy rule repeal** | Consumer protection weakened |

### Regulatory Capture

| Mechanism | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Revolving door** | FCC-industry movement |
| **Lobbying** | Industry shapes rules |
| **Comment campaigns** | Manufactured support |
| **Legal resources** | Industry challenges rules |
| **Technical complexity** | Asymmetric expertise |

### State Preemption

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Municipal broadband bans** | ~20 states restrict |
| **Industry lobbying** | State-level pressure |
| **Competition blocked** | Public option prevented |
| **Local authority limited** | Reduced alternatives |

## Policy Failures

### Definition Manipulation

| Standard | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| **25/3 Mbps definition** | Outdated, inadequate |
| **"Served" standard** | One provider sufficient |
| **Speed claims** | Advertised vs. actual |
| **Technology neutral** | Allows inferior technologies |

### Subsidy Program Flaws

| Program | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| **Universal Service Fund** | Captured by incumbents |
| **CAF II** | Funded inadequate speeds |
| **RDOF** | Questionable awards |
| **Accountability gaps** | Weak verification |

### Mapping Failures

| Issue | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| **Provider self-reporting** | Incentive to overstate |
| **Census block method** | One served = all served |
| **Verification gaps** | Claims not checked |
| **Challenge process** | Burden on consumers |
| **Data age** | Outdated information |

## Industry Behavior

### Consolidation Incentives

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Market power** | Pricing control |
| **Reduced competition** | Less pressure to invest |
| **Lobbying power** | Greater political influence |
| **Cost spreading** | Efficiency claims |

### Investment Decisions

| Pattern | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Cherry-picking** | Serve profitable areas only |
| **Upgrade deferral** | Milk existing infrastructure |
| **Marketing over investment** | Spending priorities |
| **Stock buybacks** | Capital returned to shareholders |

### Pricing Practices

| Practice | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| **Promotional pricing** | Rates rise dramatically |
| **Hidden fees** | True cost obscured |
| **Data caps** | Usage limitations |
| **Speed tiering** | Artificial scarcity |
| **Bundle requirements** | Forced purchases |

## Geographic and Demographic Factors

### Rural Challenges

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Distance** | Long cable/fiber runs |
| **Terrain** | Mountains, forests |
| **Population** | Scattered homes |
| **Income** | Lower ability to pay |

### Urban Challenges

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Redlining** | Historic disinvestment |
| **Building access** | MDU deployment barriers |
| **Competition** | Often monopoly |
| **Affordability** | High cost relative to income |

### Tribal Lands

| Challenge | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Sovereignty** | Complex jurisdiction |
| **Poverty** | Limited ability to pay |
| **Remoteness** | Extreme distances |
| **Historical neglect** | Federal underinvestment |

## Political Economy

### Industry Influence

| Mechanism | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Campaign contributions** | $100+ million per cycle |
| **Lobbying** | Hundreds of millions annually |
| **Think tanks** | Funded research |
| **Trade associations** | Coordinated messaging |

### Political Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Partisan divide** | Policy instability |
| **Rural representation** | Geographic politics |
| **State variation** | Inconsistent policy |
| **Industry jobs** | Employment leverage |

## Structural Summary

| Root Cause | Key Mechanism | Intervention Point |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Natural monopoly** | High fixed costs | Public investment |
| **Regulatory capture** | Industry influence | Reform oversight |
| **Deregulation** | Competition failure | Re-regulate |
| **Definition gaming** | Inadequate standards | Update definitions |
| **Subsidy waste** | Poor targeting | Accountability |
| **Mapping failure** | Inaccurate data | Better mapping |
| **Municipal bans** | Competition blocked | Preemption reform |
