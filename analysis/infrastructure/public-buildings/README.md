# Public Buildings: Overview

America's public buildings—federal offices, courthouses, post offices, schools, libraries, and government facilities—represent a vast infrastructure portfolio with significant deferred maintenance, accessibility gaps, and energy inefficiencies. The federal government alone owns or leases 376,000 buildings totaling 3 billion square feet, with a deferred maintenance backlog exceeding $50 billion. State and local governments face even larger challenges with schools, courthouses, and civic facilities. This document examines the current state of public building infrastructure, the factors driving deterioration, and pathways to modernization.
