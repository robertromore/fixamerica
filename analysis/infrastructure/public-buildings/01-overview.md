# Public Buildings: Overview

## Executive Summary

America's public buildings—federal offices, courthouses, post offices, schools, libraries, and government facilities—represent a vast infrastructure portfolio with significant deferred maintenance, accessibility gaps, and energy inefficiencies. The federal government alone owns or leases 376,000 buildings totaling 3 billion square feet, with a deferred maintenance backlog exceeding $50 billion. State and local governments face even larger challenges with schools, courthouses, and civic facilities. This document examines the current state of public building infrastructure, the factors driving deterioration, and pathways to modernization.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Federal buildings**: GSA facilities, agency-owned buildings
- **Courthouses**: Federal and state court facilities
- **Schools**: K-12 public school facilities
- **Post offices**: USPS retail and processing facilities
- **Libraries**: Public library buildings
- **Civic facilities**: City halls, community centers
- **Public safety**: Police stations, fire stations
- **Health facilities**: Public hospitals, clinics, VA facilities
