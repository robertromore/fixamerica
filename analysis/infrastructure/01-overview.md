# Infrastructure Policy

## Overview

America's infrastructure is the physical foundation of the economy and daily life. Roads, bridges, water systems, broadband networks, ports, airports, and public buildings enable commerce, connect communities, and deliver essential services. After decades of underinvestment, much of this infrastructure is aging, inadequate, and increasingly vulnerable to climate impacts.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Transportation**: Roads, bridges, rail, airports, ports, waterways
- **Water**: Drinking water, wastewater, stormwater, dams, levees
- **Digital**: Broadband, telecommunications infrastructure
- **Energy**: Grid, transmission (covered in environment domain)
- **Public facilities**: Government buildings, schools, hospitals
- **Crosscutting issues**: Finance, resilience, maintenance

## The Infrastructure Challenge

### System Condition

| Category | ASCE Grade | Primary Issues |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Roads** | D | Poor conditions, congestion |
| **Bridges** | C | Structural deficiency, age |
| **Transit** | D- | Maintenance backlog |
| **Rail** | B | Freight vs. passenger gaps |
| **Aviation** | D+ | Capacity, aging facilities |
| **Ports** | B- | Modernization needs |
| **Dams** | D | Safety hazards, age |
| **Drinking water** | C- | Lead, breaks, aging pipes |
| **Wastewater** | D+ | Combined overflows, capacity |
| **Broadband** | C | Coverage gaps, affordability |

### Investment Gap

| Sector | 10-Year Need | Current Funding |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Surface transportation** | $2.0 trillion | $1.2 trillion |
| **Water/wastewater** | $434 billion | $253 billion |
| **Electricity** | $338 billion | $257 billion |
| **Airports** | $237 billion | $115 billion |
| **Broadband** | $100+ billion | Growing |

## Why This Matters

### Economic Impact

| Impact | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| **Productivity loss** | $130B+ annual congestion cost |
| **Vehicle damage** | $600+ per driver annually |
| **Supply chain** | Delays raise consumer costs |
| **Competitiveness** | Global infrastructure rankings falling |
| **Job creation** | 15,000+ jobs per $1B invested |

### Safety and Health

| Issue | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| **Traffic fatalities** | 40,000+ deaths annually |
| **Dam failures** | Life and property risk |
| **Lead pipes** | Child health impacts |
| **Water contamination** | Disease outbreaks |
| **Bridge collapses** | Catastrophic failures |

### Equity and Access

| Dimension | Gap |
|-----------|-----|
| **Rural connectivity** | Broadband, transit deserts |
| **Low-income communities** | Deferred maintenance |
| **Communities of color** | Historic disinvestment |
| **Disability access** | ADA compliance gaps |

### Climate Vulnerability

| Risk | Infrastructure Impact |
|------|----------------------|
| **Extreme heat** | Road buckling, rail kinks |
| **Flooding** | Bridge scour, dam overtopping |
| **Sea level rise** | Coastal infrastructure |
| **Wildfires** | Transmission lines, roads |
| **Severe storms** | Power outages, damage |

## Federal Role

### Key Programs

| Program | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| **Highway Trust Fund** | Surface transportation |
| **Airport Improvement Program** | Aviation |
| **BEAD** | Broadband deployment |
| **WIFIA** | Water infrastructure loans |
| **BUILD/RAISE** | Discretionary grants |
| **FTA** | Transit capital and operations |

### Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)

| Category | 5-Year Funding |
|----------|----------------|
| **Roads and bridges** | $110 billion |
| **Public transit** | $89 billion |
| **Passenger rail** | $66 billion |
| **Broadband** | $65 billion |
| **Clean water** | $55 billion |
| **Airports** | $25 billion |
| **Ports and waterways** | $17 billion |
| **Electric vehicles** | $7.5 billion |

## State and Local Role

### Responsibility Distribution

| Level | Primary Responsibility |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Federal** | Interstate, waterways, aviation, grants |
| **State** | State highways, bridges, coordination |
| **Local** | Local roads, water, buildings |
| **Special districts** | Transit, ports, utilities |

### Funding Sources

| Source | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Gas tax** | Highway funding |
| **Property tax** | Local infrastructure |
| **Sales tax** | Transit, general |
| **User fees** | Water, tolls |
| **Bonds** | Capital projects |

## Key Tensions

| Tension | Dimensions |
|---------|------------|
| **New vs. maintenance** | Ribbon-cutting vs. fix-it-first |
| **Urban vs. rural** | Investment allocation |
| **Cars vs. transit** | Mode priorities |
| **Growth vs. resilience** | Expansion vs. hardening |
| **Public vs. private** | Ownership and financing |
| **Federal vs. state** | Control and standards |

## Reform Priorities

1. **Sustainable funding** - Replace eroding gas tax with durable revenue
2. **Fix-it-first** - Prioritize maintenance over new construction
3. **Climate resilience** - Adapt infrastructure to changing conditions
4. **Equity focus** - Address historic disinvestment
5. **Broadband universal** - Close digital divide
6. **Asset management** - Data-driven lifecycle decisions
7. **Safety** - Vision Zero, dam safety, lead removal
8. **Multimodal** - Integrate transportation modes
9. **Workforce** - Build skilled labor pipeline
10. **Accountability** - Performance metrics, transparency
