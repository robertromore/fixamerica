# Infrastructure Policy

America's infrastructure is the physical foundation of the economy and daily life. Roads, bridges, water systems, broadband networks, ports, airports, and public buildings enable commerce, connect communities, and deliver essential services. After decades of underinvestment, much of this infrastructure is aging, inadequate, and increasingly vulnerable to climate impacts.
