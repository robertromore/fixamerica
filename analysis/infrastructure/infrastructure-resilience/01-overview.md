# Infrastructure Resilience: Overview

## Executive Summary

America's infrastructure faces growing threats from climate change, extreme weather, cyberattacks, and physical attacks. Billion-dollar disasters now occur with increasing frequency, exposing vulnerabilities in systems designed for historical conditions. Infrastructure resilience—the ability to anticipate, absorb, adapt to, and rapidly recover from disruptions—has become essential for public safety, economic security, and national defense. This document examines the resilience challenges facing American infrastructure, their causes, and pathways to more robust systems.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Climate resilience**: Adapting to changing conditions
- **Natural disaster preparedness**: Hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, wildfires
- **Extreme weather**: Heat, cold, precipitation events
- **Cybersecurity**: Protecting critical infrastructure systems
- **Physical security**: Protecting against attacks and accidents
- **System redundancy**: Backup capacity and alternatives
- **Recovery capability**: Rapid restoration after disruptions

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Billion-dollar disasters (2023)** | 28 events |
| **Average annual disaster losses** | $100+ billion |
| **Power outage hours (annual)** | 7+ hours per customer |
| **Critical infrastructure sectors** | 16 designated |
| **Infrastructure at flood risk** | $1+ trillion |
| **Wildfire-threatened infrastructure** | Growing annually |

## Major Threat Categories

### Climate-Related

| Threat | Infrastructure Impact |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Sea level rise** | Coastal roads, ports, airports |
| **Increased flooding** | Bridges, dams, water systems |
| **Extreme heat** | Rail, roads, power systems |
| **Wildfires** | Power lines, communications, roads |
| **Hurricanes** | All coastal infrastructure |
| **Drought** | Water systems, hydropower |

### Non-Climate Threats

| Threat | Infrastructure Impact |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Cyberattacks** | Power grid, water, transportation |
| **Physical attacks** | Substations, pipelines, bridges |
| **Earthquakes** | Bridges, buildings, pipelines |
| **Pandemics** | Supply chains, workforce |
| **Cascading failures** | Interdependent systems |

## Sector Vulnerabilities

| Sector | Primary Vulnerabilities |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Electric grid** | Weather, cyber, physical |
| **Transportation** | Flooding, heat, weather |
| **Water systems** | Drought, flooding, contamination |
| **Communications** | Weather, cyber, physical |
| **Buildings** | Seismic, flood, wind |
| **Dams and levees** | Flooding, age, overtopping |

## Economic Impact

| Category | Annual Costs |
|----------|--------------|
| **Direct disaster damage** | $50-100+ billion |
| **Economic disruption** | $50+ billion |
| **Infrastructure repair** | $25+ billion |
| **Resilience investment** | $10+ billion |

## Current Resilience Gaps

| Gap | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Design standards** | Based on historical, not future conditions |
| **Investment** | Insufficient for hardening and adaptation |
| **Planning** | Siloed, not system-wide |
| **Data** | Inadequate vulnerability information |
| **Governance** | Fragmented responsibility |
| **Incentives** | Undervalue resilience |

## Stakeholder Overview

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|-------------|----------|
| **Federal agencies** | National security, disaster response |
| **State/local government** | Community protection |
| **Utilities** | System reliability |
| **Infrastructure owners** | Asset protection |
| **Insurance industry** | Risk management |
| **Communities** | Safety, service continuity |

## Reform Opportunities

| Opportunity | Potential |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Updated standards** | Design for future conditions |
| **Resilience investment** | Dedicated funding |
| **System planning** | Integrated approach |
| **Risk information** | Better data and tools |
| **Incentive alignment** | Value resilience properly |
| **Redundancy** | Backup systems |
