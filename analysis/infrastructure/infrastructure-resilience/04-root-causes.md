# Infrastructure Resilience: Root Causes

## Overview

Infrastructure vulnerability stems from a combination of climate change, aging systems, inadequate investment, and governance failures. Understanding these root causes is essential for building effective resilience strategies.

## Climate Change

### Accelerating Threats

| Threat | Trend |
|--------|-------|
| **Temperature** | Rising faster than projected |
| **Sea level** | Accelerating rise |
| **Precipitation intensity** | More extreme events |
| **Hurricane intensity** | Stronger storms |
| **Wildfire conditions** | Longer, more severe seasons |
| **Compound events** | Multiple hazards simultaneously |

### Infrastructure Design Mismatch

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Historical design** | Based on past conditions |
| **Climate non-stationarity** | Past not predictive of future |
| **Standards lag** | Codes don't reflect new reality |
| **Uncertainty** | Difficulty planning for range of futures |

### Future Projections

| Factor | Mid-Century Change |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Sea level** | 1-4 feet additional rise |
| **Extreme heat days** | 2-5x increase in many regions |
| **Precipitation extremes** | 10-30% increase |
| **Category 4-5 hurricanes** | Increased frequency |
| **Wildfire area** | 2-6x increase |

## Aging Infrastructure

### System Age

| System | Average Age |
|--------|-------------|
| **Dams** | 57 years |
| **Bridges** | 44 years |
| **Water mains** | Many 50-100+ years |
| **Power transformers** | 40+ years |
| **Levees** | Many 50+ years |

### Age-Related Vulnerabilities

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Material fatigue** | Reduced strength |
| **Corrosion** | Structural degradation |
| **Obsolete design** | Doesn't meet current standards |
| **Component failure** | Critical systems fail |
| **Deferred maintenance** | Compounding deterioration |

## Underinvestment

### Resilience Funding Gap

| Category | Annual Gap |
|----------|------------|
| **Pre-disaster mitigation** | $10+ billion |
| **Infrastructure hardening** | $20+ billion |
| **Climate adaptation** | $15+ billion |
| **Cybersecurity** | $5+ billion |

### Investment Barriers

| Barrier | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Upfront costs** | Resilience costs more initially |
| **Benefit uncertainty** | Hard to quantify avoided losses |
| **Long time horizons** | Benefits accrue over decades |
| **Split incentives** | Investor ≠ beneficiary |
| **Discount rates** | Undervalue future benefits |

### Cost-Benefit Challenges

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Disaster probability** | Low probability, high consequence |
| **Future discounting** | Reduced present value |
| **Externalities** | Not fully captured |
| **Equity** | Uneven distribution |

## Governance Failures

### Fragmented Responsibility

| Level | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| **Federal** | Standards, some funding |
| **State** | Building codes, some infrastructure |
| **Local** | Land use, local infrastructure |
| **Private** | Most infrastructure operations |

### Coordination Challenges

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Siloed planning** | No system-wide view |
| **Jurisdictional gaps** | Cross-boundary vulnerabilities |
| **Different standards** | Inconsistent protection |
| **Information gaps** | Limited data sharing |

### Regulatory Gaps

| Gap | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Cyber requirements** | Limited mandatory standards |
| **Climate standards** | Not required in design |
| **Flood maps** | Outdated, incomplete |
| **Private infrastructure** | Limited oversight |

## Information Deficits

### Data Gaps

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| **Vulnerability assessments** | Many not conducted |
| **Condition data** | Incomplete inventory |
| **Risk modeling** | Limited climate integration |
| **Interdependencies** | Poorly understood |

### Uncertainty

| Source | Challenge |
|--------|-----------|
| **Climate projections** | Range of scenarios |
| **Event frequency** | Statistical uncertainty |
| **System behavior** | Cascading failure complexity |
| **Future development** | Land use change |

## Incentive Problems

### Misaligned Incentives

| Actor | Misalignment |
|-------|--------------|
| **Property owners** | Insurance subsidizes risk |
| **Developers** | Don't bear long-term costs |
| **Utilities** | Rate recovery uncertain |
| **Governments** | Federal backstop reduces local incentive |

### Moral Hazard

| Dynamic | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Disaster aid expectation** | Reduced local preparedness |
| **Flood insurance subsidies** | Development in flood zones |
| **Infrastructure bailouts** | Underinvestment in maintenance |

## Development Patterns

### At-Risk Development

| Pattern | Risk |
|---------|------|
| **Coastal development** | Sea level, storms |
| **Floodplain development** | Flooding |
| **Wildland-urban interface** | Wildfire |
| **Heat island effect** | Extreme heat |

### Land Use Failures

| Failure | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Zoning allows risk** | Development in hazardous areas |
| **Impervious surface** | Increased flooding |
| **Wetland loss** | Reduced natural protection |
| **Forest management** | Increased fire risk |

## System Interdependencies

### Cascade Vulnerability

| Primary | Cascading Impact |
|---------|------------------|
| **Power outage** | Water, communications, transportation |
| **Communications** | Emergency response, coordination |
| **Transportation** | Supply chains, evacuation |
| **Water** | Public health, firefighting |

### Concentration Risk

| Concentration | Vulnerability |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Internet exchange points** | Single points of failure |
| **Pipeline hubs** | Fuel distribution |
| **Port clusters** | Supply chain |
| **Grid interconnections** | Regional failures |

## Summary of Root Causes

| Category | Primary Causes |
|----------|----------------|
| **Climate** | Accelerating threats, design mismatch |
| **Infrastructure** | Aging systems, deferred maintenance |
| **Investment** | Inadequate funding, poor incentives |
| **Governance** | Fragmentation, regulatory gaps |
| **Information** | Data deficits, uncertainty |
| **Development** | At-risk building, poor land use |
| **Systems** | Interdependencies, concentration |
