# Infrastructure Resilience: Overview

America's infrastructure faces growing threats from climate change, extreme weather, cyberattacks, and physical attacks. Billion-dollar disasters now occur with increasing frequency, exposing vulnerabilities in systems designed for historical conditions. Infrastructure resilience—the ability to anticipate, absorb, adapt to, and rapidly recover from disruptions—has become essential for public safety, economic security, and national defense. This document examines the resilience challenges facing American infrastructure, their causes, and pathways to more robust systems.
