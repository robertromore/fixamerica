# Infrastructure Resilience: History

## Overview

Infrastructure resilience emerged as a policy priority through a series of wake-up calls: devastating natural disasters, infrastructure failures, and emerging threats. The historical evolution from reactive disaster response to proactive resilience building reflects hard lessons learned.
