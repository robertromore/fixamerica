# Roads and Bridges: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Transforming road and bridge infrastructure requires federal reauthorization reform, sustainable funding legislation, safety mandates, and state-level action. This document provides draft legislation for key reforms and analysis of existing legal frameworks, including loopholes that undermine current policies.
