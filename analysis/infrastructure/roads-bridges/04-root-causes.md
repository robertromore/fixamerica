# Roads and Bridges: Root Causes

## Overview

Deteriorating road and bridge conditions result from structural funding problems, political incentives favoring new construction over maintenance, fragmented responsibility across government levels, and inadequate attention to safety and resilience. Addressing these root causes requires reforming financing mechanisms, changing institutional incentives, and rethinking infrastructure priorities.

## Funding Structure Problems

### Gas Tax Erosion

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Inflation** | 1993 tax worth ~40% today |
| **Fuel efficiency** | More miles, less tax |
| **Electric vehicles** | Pay no fuel tax |
| **Political resistance** | No federal increase since 1993 |
| **Real revenue decline** | Purchasing power falling |

### Trust Fund Insolvency

| Issue | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| **Structural deficit** | $15+ billion annual shortfall |
| **General fund bailouts** | $275 billion since 2008 |
| **User fee erosion** | No longer true user-pays |
| **Political dysfunction** | Can't agree on fix |

### State Funding Variation

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Unequal gas taxes** | 18 cents (Alaska) to 68 cents (California) |
| **Political will** | Some states raise, others don't |
| **Revenue adequacy** | Wide variation |
| **Local dependence** | Property tax competition |

## Political and Institutional Factors

### Construction Bias

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Ribbon-cutting** | Politicians prefer new projects |
| **Visible projects** | Maintenance less noticed |
| **Construction jobs** | Immediate employment |
| **Federal matching** | Higher for new than repair |
| **Engineering culture** | Build bias in profession |

### Fragmented Responsibility

| Level | Share |
|-------|-------|
| **Federal** | 25% of highway spending |
| **State** | 45% of highway spending |
| **Local** | 30% of highway spending |

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Split accountability** | No one fully responsible |
| **Coordination gaps** | Inefficient investment |
| **Fiscal mismatch** | Needs vs. resources misaligned |
| **Political blame-shifting** | Deferred decisions |

### Short-Term Thinking

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Election cycles** | 2-4 year horizons |
| **Budget cycles** | Annual appropriations |
| **Deferred maintenance** | Cheaper short-term |
| **Lifecycle cost neglect** | Initial cost focus |
| **Asset management gaps** | Poor data use |

## Technical and Design Factors

### Aging Infrastructure

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Interstate age** | Much built 1960s-70s |
| **Design life exceeded** | 50-year bridges now 60+ |
| **Traffic growth** | Exceeded original projections |
| **Weight increases** | Heavier trucks |
| **Standards evolution** | Older designs deficient |

### Design Standards Issues

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Car-centric design** | Pedestrian danger |
| **Speed priority** | Higher crash severity |
| **Forgiving design** | Encourages risk |
| **Wide lanes** | Induces speeding |
| **Intersection design** | Conflict points |

### Climate Vulnerability

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Heat** | Pavement deterioration |
| **Precipitation changes** | Flooding, erosion |
| **Freeze-thaw** | Northern damage |
| **Sea level rise** | Coastal infrastructure |
| **Extreme events** | Catastrophic damage |

## Safety System Failures

### Speed as Default

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Design speed** | Built for high speeds |
| **Speed limits** | Often higher than safe |
| **Enforcement decline** | Less traffic enforcement |
| **Vehicle size** | Larger, more dangerous |
| **Vulnerable road users** | Pedestrians, cyclists at risk |

### Institutional Failures

| Issue | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| **No accountability** | Deaths not penalized |
| **Engineering immunity** | Design choices protected |
| **Crash investigation** | Blames drivers, not roads |
| **Data gaps** | Incomplete crash analysis |
| **Siloed agencies** | Safety not integrated |

## Economic and Market Factors

### Construction Industry Interests

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Lobbying** | Prefer new construction |
| **Workforce** | Skills favor new build |
| **Equipment** | Capital for construction |
| **Contracts** | Larger for new projects |

### Induced Demand

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Capacity expansion** | Generates more traffic |
| **Temporary relief** | Congestion returns |
| **Land use effects** | Sprawl follows highways |
| **Feedback loop** | More roads → more driving |

## Equity Dimensions

### Geographic Disparities

| Area | Challenge |
|------|-----------|
| **Rural** | Lower priority, funding gaps |
| **Urban** | Congestion, maintenance backlog |
| **Poor communities** | Worse conditions, less service |
| **Communities of color** | Highway damage legacy |

### Access Inequity

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Transit alternatives** | Limited in most areas |
| **Pedestrian facilities** | Absent in many places |
| **Bridge restrictions** | Rural economic impacts |
| **Cost burden** | Low-income vehicle costs |

## Structural Summary

| Root Cause | Key Mechanism | Intervention Point |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Gas tax erosion** | Declining real revenue | New funding mechanism |
| **Construction bias** | Political incentives | Fix-it-first requirements |
| **Fragmented authority** | Split responsibility | Accountability reform |
| **Short-termism** | Election cycles | Asset management |
| **Design standards** | Speed priority | Safety-first design |
| **Climate neglect** | Resilience underinvestment | Adaptation funding |
| **Equity gaps** | Historical patterns | Targeted investment |
