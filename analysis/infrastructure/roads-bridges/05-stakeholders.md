# Roads and Bridges: Stakeholders

## Overview

Road and bridge infrastructure involves diverse stakeholders with varying interests: transportation agencies responsible for construction and maintenance, construction industries seeking project funding, freight carriers dependent on the network, safety advocates pushing for design changes, and communities affected by both the presence and absence of infrastructure. Understanding these stakeholders is essential for building coalitions and navigating opposition to reform.
