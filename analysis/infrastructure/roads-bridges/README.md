# Roads and Bridges: Overview

America's road and bridge infrastructure is aging, underfunded, and inadequate for current needs. Over 45,000 bridges are structurally deficient, while road conditions cost drivers billions in vehicle damage and lost time. Despite recent federal investment through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), decades of deferred maintenance have created a backlog that will take sustained commitment to address. Meanwhile, the transportation system must adapt to changing needs including climate resilience, safety improvements, and evolving vehicle technology.
