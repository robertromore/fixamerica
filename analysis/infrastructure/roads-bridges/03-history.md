# Roads and Bridges: History

## Overview

American road infrastructure evolved from colonial post roads through the Interstate Highway System that transformed the nation. Federal involvement grew from minimal to dominant over the 20th century, driven by military needs, economic development, and automobile proliferation. Understanding this history reveals how current funding structures, design standards, and institutional arrangements emerged—and why reform is difficult.
