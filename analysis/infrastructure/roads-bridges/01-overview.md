# Roads and Bridges: Overview

## Executive Summary

America's road and bridge infrastructure is aging, underfunded, and inadequate for current needs. Over 45,000 bridges are structurally deficient, while road conditions cost drivers billions in vehicle damage and lost time. Despite recent federal investment through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), decades of deferred maintenance have created a backlog that will take sustained commitment to address. Meanwhile, the transportation system must adapt to changing needs including climate resilience, safety improvements, and evolving vehicle technology.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Highway system**: Interstate, U.S. routes, state highways
- **Bridges and tunnels**: Structural infrastructure
- **Local roads**: County, municipal, rural roads
- **Funding mechanisms**: Gas tax, tolling, federal programs
- **Safety**: Design, maintenance, crash reduction
- **Climate adaptation**: Resilience, flooding, heat damage

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Total road miles** | 4.19 million | Largest network in world |
| **Bridges** | 617,000+ | Federal inventory |
| **Structurally deficient bridges** | 45,000+ | 7.5% of total |
| **Poor condition roads** | 19% | Causing vehicle damage |
| **Annual infrastructure grade** | C- | ASCE Report Card |
| **Repair backlog** | $786 billion | Roads alone |
| **Bridge repair needs** | $125 billion | Current backlog |

## Scale of the Challenge

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Physical condition** | Significant deterioration |
| **Capacity** | Congestion in urban areas |
| **Safety** | 40,000+ annual traffic deaths |
| **Climate vulnerability** | Increasing damage from extreme weather |
| **Funding gap** | Revenues falling short of needs |

## Problem Statement

The road and bridge system faces interconnected challenges:

1. **Deferred maintenance**: Decades of underinvestment
2. **Aging infrastructure**: Much built 50-70 years ago
3. **Funding decline**: Gas tax revenue eroding
4. **Safety failures**: High fatality rates persist
5. **Climate impacts**: More frequent damage events
6. **Equity gaps**: Rural and low-income areas underserved
7. **Congestion**: Economic productivity losses

## Root Causes Summary

| Cause | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **Gas tax stagnation** | Not raised federally since 1993 |
| **Construction bias** | New roads over maintenance |
| **Political incentives** | Ribbon-cutting preference |
| **Fragmented responsibility** | Federal/state/local split |
| **Lifecycle cost neglect** | Initial cost focus |
| **Climate denial** | Resilience underinvestment |

## Solution Directions

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Sustainable funding** | Replace/supplement gas tax |
| **Fix-it-first** | Prioritize maintenance |
| **Safety redesign** | Vision Zero approach |
| **Climate resilience** | Adaptation investment |
| **Asset management** | Data-driven decisions |
| **Complete streets** | Multimodal design |

## Stakeholder Landscape

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|-------------|----------|
| **State DOTs** | Primary highway managers |
| **Local governments** | Local road responsibility |
| **Construction industry** | Project funding |
| **Trucking industry** | Freight movement |
| **Drivers** | Road conditions, safety |
| **Transit users** | Multimodal connections |
| **Environmental groups** | Emissions, land use |
| **Safety advocates** | Fatality reduction |

## Why This Matters

| Impact | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| **Economic** | $130 billion annual congestion cost |
| **Safety** | 40,000+ deaths per year |
| **Vehicle costs** | $600+ per driver annually |
| **Competitiveness** | Supply chain efficiency |
| **Equity** | Mobility access disparities |
| **Climate** | Vulnerability to extreme weather |
