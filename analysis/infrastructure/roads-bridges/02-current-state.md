# Roads and Bridges: Current State

## Overview

America's roads and bridges are in fair to poor condition, with significant regional variation. Despite the largest federal infrastructure investment in decades through the 2021 IIJA, the backlog of needed repairs continues to grow. Bridges face particularly acute challenges, with thousands rated structurally deficient. Road safety remains a crisis, with fatalities rising rather than declining in recent years.
