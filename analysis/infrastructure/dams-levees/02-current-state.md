# Dams and Levees: Current State

## Overview

America's dam and levee infrastructure faces a convergence of challenges: aging structures, changing climate, inadequate funding, and uneven regulation. While federal facilities receive more attention, the majority of dams are privately owned with limited oversight, and many levees lack clear ownership or maintenance responsibility.
