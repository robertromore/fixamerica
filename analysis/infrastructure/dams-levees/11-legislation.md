3. **Expand private dam assistance** with accountability
4. **Complete inventories** within defined timelines
5. **Update climate guidance** and require incorporation
6. **Strengthen enforcement** authority and resources
7. **Improve EAP requirements** including exercises
8. **Clarify levee ownership** and responsibility
9. **Support dam removal** as risk reduction option

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| **Political will** | Build bipartisan support |
| **State capacity** | Technical assistance |
