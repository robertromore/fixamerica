# Dams and Levees: Overview

## Executive Summary

America's 91,000 dams and 100,000 miles of levees form critical infrastructure for flood control, water supply, hydroelectric power, recreation, and navigation. Yet the system faces a mounting crisis: the average dam is 57 years old, over 15,000 dams are rated as "high-hazard potential," and the estimated cost to rehabilitate non-federal dams alone exceeds $76 billion. Meanwhile, climate change intensifies the hydrological extremes these structures must withstand. This document examines the current state of American dams and levees, the policies that created today's challenges, and pathways to modernization.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Dams**: Federal, state, local, and private structures
- **Levees**: Federal and non-federal flood protection systems
- **Dam safety**: Inspection, regulation, emergency planning
- **Flood risk management**: Structural and non-structural approaches
- **Hydropower**: Energy generation infrastructure
- **Water supply**: Storage and distribution
- **Environmental considerations**: Fish passage, ecosystem impacts
- **Climate adaptation**: Changing hydrology, extreme events

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total dams** | ~91,000 |
| **High-hazard potential dams** | ~15,600 |
| **Significant-hazard dams** | ~11,800 |
| **Average dam age** | 57 years |
| **Dams over 50 years** | ~70% |
| **Dam rehabilitation cost** | $76+ billion (non-federal) |
| **Levee miles** | ~100,000 |
| **Population behind levees** | 43 million |

## Federal Dam Portfolio

| Agency | Number of Dams | Primary Purpose |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Army Corps of Engineers** | ~700 | Flood control, navigation |
| **Bureau of Reclamation** | ~470 | Water supply, irrigation |
| **Tennessee Valley Authority** | ~49 | Flood control, power |
| **Federal Energy Regulatory Commission** | ~2,500 (licensed) | Hydropower |
| **Other federal** | Various | Multiple purposes |

## Dam Ownership

| Owner Type | Approximate Share |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Private** | 56% |
| **State/Local** | 23% |
| **Federal** | 5% |
| **Public utilities** | 16% |

## Core Problems

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Aging infrastructure** | Deterioration, reduced safety margins |
| **Deferred maintenance** | $76+ billion non-federal backlog |
| **Inadequate spillways** | Cannot pass probable maximum flood |
| **Climate change** | Exceeds design assumptions |
| **Regulatory gaps** | Many dams unregulated or under-regulated |
| **Levee uncertainty** | Unknown condition, unaccredited systems |
| **Development in flood zones** | Increased exposure |

## Levee Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Unknown inventory** | Many levees undocumented |
| **Condition uncertainty** | Limited inspection data |
| **FEMA accreditation** | Many systems fail standards |
| **Residual risk** | False sense of security |
| **Maintenance responsibility** | Unclear ownership |

## Dam Safety Incidents

| Decade | Notable Incidents |
|--------|-------------------|
| **1970s** | Buffalo Creek (WV), Teton Dam (ID) |
| **1980s** | Lawn Lake (CO) |
| **2010s** | Oroville spillway (CA) |
| **2020s** | Edenville/Sanford (MI) |

## Economic Context

| Category | Annual Value |
|----------|--------------|
| **Flood damage prevented** | $40+ billion (federal dams) |
| **Hydropower generation** | 6-7% of U.S. electricity |
| **Irrigation water** | Millions of acres |
| **Municipal water** | Millions served |
| **Recreation** | Billions in economic activity |

## Stakeholder Overview

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|-------------|----------|
| **Federal agencies** | Dam safety, flood control |
| **State dam safety programs** | Regulation, inspection |
| **Local governments** | Flood protection, water supply |
| **Private dam owners** | Liability, costs |
| **Communities** | Flood risk, water supply |
| **Environmental groups** | Fish passage, dam removal |
| **Hydropower industry** | Generation capacity |

## Reform Opportunities

| Opportunity | Potential |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Federal investment** | Rehabilitation of federal dams |
| **Grant programs** | State and private dam assistance |
| **Regulatory modernization** | Consistent standards |
| **Dam removal** | Eliminate obsolete structures |
| **Levee accreditation** | Risk-informed approach |
| **Climate adaptation** | Update design standards |
