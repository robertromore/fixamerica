# Dams and Levees: Solutions

## Overview

Addressing the dam and levee infrastructure challenge requires a comprehensive approach: increased investment, regulatory modernization, strategic dam removal, risk-informed management, and climate adaptation. Solutions must balance safety, environmental, and economic considerations while recognizing the diverse ownership and condition of these structures.
