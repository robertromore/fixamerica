# Dams and Levees: Root Causes

## Overview

The deteriorating condition of America's dams and levees stems from predictable causes: aging infrastructure built for different conditions, chronic underfunding, fragmented governance, and continued development in flood-prone areas. Understanding these root causes is essential for developing effective solutions.

## Aging Infrastructure

### Design Life Exceeded

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Average dam age** | 57 years (many designed for 50-year life) |
| **Design standards** | Based on historical hydrology |
| **Materials degradation** | Concrete, earthen embankments deteriorate |
| **Seepage increase** | Internal erosion develops over time |
| **Spillway inadequacy** | Cannot pass updated probable maximum flood |

### Changed Conditions

| Original Assumption | Current Reality |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Static climate** | Changing precipitation patterns |
| **Limited downstream development** | Extensive development |
| **Stable watershed** | Urbanization, land use change |
| **Original design flood** | Updated standards require more capacity |

## Funding Inadequacy

### Federal Backlog

| Agency | Maintenance Backlog |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Army Corps of Engineers** | $20+ billion |
| **Bureau of Reclamation** | $3+ billion |
| **Other federal** | $1+ billion |
| **Total federal** | $25+ billion |

### Non-Federal Funding Gap

| Category | Estimated Need |
|----------|---------------|
| **High-hazard potential dams** | $21+ billion |
| **Significant hazard dams** | $18+ billion |
| **State dam safety programs** | Severely underfunded |
| **Total non-federal** | $76+ billion |

### Funding Structure Problems

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Discretionary budgets** | Compete with other priorities |
| **No dedicated revenue** | No dam/levee trust fund |
| **Split responsibilities** | Federal, state, local, private |
| **Invisible infrastructure** | Less politically visible than highways |

## Governance Fragmentation

### Dam Ownership Complexity

| Owner Type | Challenges |
|------------|------------|
| **Federal (multiple agencies)** | Different standards, priorities |
| **State** | Variable capacity, funding |
| **Local** | Limited technical expertise |
| **Private** | Financial constraints, liability concerns |
| **Unknown** | Orphaned dams, unclear title |

### Regulatory Gaps

| Gap | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Federal dams** | Exempt from state regulation |
| **Small dams** | Exempt in many states |
| **Agricultural dams** | Excluded from requirements |
| **State variation** | 50 different regulatory schemes |
| **Enforcement** | Limited resources for compliance |

### Levee Governance

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ownership uncertainty** | Many levees have no clear owner |
| **Maintenance responsibility** | Often unclear or unfunded |
| **Accreditation** | Complex, expensive process |
| **Federal-local disconnect** | Different standards, expectations |

## Risk Accumulation

### Development Behind Dams and Levees

| Pattern | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Increased property values** | More assets at risk |
| **Population growth** | More people exposed |
| **Infrastructure dependence** | Critical facilities in flood zones |
| **False security** | "Levee effect" encourages development |

### The "Levee Effect"

| Dynamic | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **1** | Levee/dam built for flood protection |
| **2** | Development increases behind structure |
| **3** | Consequences of failure increase |
| **4** | Higher standards required |
| **5** | Costs escalate beyond funding capacity |
| **6** | Risk increases despite protection |

## Climate Change

### Hydrological Changes

| Change | Impact on Infrastructure |
|--------|-------------------------|
| **Increased precipitation intensity** | Exceeds spillway design |
| **Changed precipitation timing** | Alters reservoir operations |
| **More extreme events** | Structures face higher loads |
| **Sea level rise** | Coastal levee challenges |
| **Longer droughts** | Water supply stress |

### Design Standard Obsolescence

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Probable Maximum Precipitation** | Based on historical data |
| **Probable Maximum Flood** | May underestimate future risk |
| **Freeboard assumptions** | Reduced safety margins |
| **Operating rules** | Designed for different hydrology |

## Institutional Factors

### Benefit-Cost Analysis Limitations

| Problem | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Discount rates** | Undervalue future benefits |
| **Risk quantification** | Difficult to price catastrophic risk |
| **Environmental costs** | Historically undercounted |
| **Equity considerations** | Often ignored |

### Political Incentives

| Incentive | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| **New vs. maintenance** | Ribbon-cutting bias |
| **Geographic distribution** | Projects spread politically |
| **Short-term focus** | Multi-decade infrastructure vs. election cycles |
| **Crisis response** | React to failures, not prevent them |

### Emergency Threshold

| Dynamic | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Pre-failure** | Little political attention |
| **During crisis** | Intense focus |
| **Post-crisis** | Funding for affected structure |
| **System-wide** | Attention fades quickly |

## Knowledge Gaps

### Dam Safety Data

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| **Incomplete inventory** | Unknown structures |
| **Inconsistent inspections** | Variable quality |
| **Condition uncertainty** | Unknown failure probability |
| **Downstream hazard** | Incomplete inundation mapping |

### Levee Information

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| **Unknown levees** | Many undocumented |
| **Condition assessment** | Limited inspection data |
| **Interior drainage** | Uncertain capacity |
| **System interaction** | Complex failure modes |

## Private Owner Challenges

### Financial Constraints

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Rehabilitation costs** | Exceed owner resources |
| **Insurance unavailable** | Dam liability difficult to insure |
| **Property value** | Often doesn't support investment |
| **Lender requirements** | May not require dam maintenance |

### Technical Limitations

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Engineering expertise** | Not accessible to most owners |
| **Regulatory complexity** | Difficult to navigate |
| **Contractor availability** | Limited dam construction specialists |
| **Standard designs** | Not available for most situations |

## Feedback Loops

### Deferred Maintenance Spiral

```
Limited funding → Deferred maintenance → Deterioration
       ↑                                      ↓
   Budget pressure ← Growing backlog ← Higher repair costs
```

### Risk Accumulation Cycle

```
Flood protection → Development → Higher stakes
       ↑                              ↓
   Demand for more ← Failure impact ← Greater risk
   protection increases
```

## Summary of Root Causes

| Category | Primary Causes |
|----------|----------------|
| **Physical** | Aging infrastructure, exceeded design life |
| **Financial** | Chronic underfunding, no dedicated revenue |
| **Governance** | Fragmented ownership, regulatory gaps |
| **Development** | Continued building in flood zones |
| **Climate** | Changing hydrology, extreme events |
| **Political** | Short-term focus, crisis-driven response |
| **Knowledge** | Data gaps, condition uncertainty |
