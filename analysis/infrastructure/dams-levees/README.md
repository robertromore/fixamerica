# Dams and Levees: Overview

America's 91,000 dams and 100,000 miles of levees form critical infrastructure for flood control, water supply, hydroelectric power, recreation, and navigation. Yet the system faces a mounting crisis: the average dam is 57 years old, over 15,000 dams are rated as "high-hazard potential," and the estimated cost to rehabilitate non-federal dams alone exceeds $76 billion. Meanwhile, climate change intensifies the hydrological extremes these structures must withstand. This document examines the current state of American dams and levees, the policies that created today's challenges, and pathways to modernization.
