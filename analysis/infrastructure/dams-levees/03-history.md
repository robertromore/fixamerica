# Dams and Levees: History

## Overview

America's dam-building era fundamentally reshaped the nation's waterways, enabling agricultural development, hydroelectric power, flood control, and urban water supply. The history of dams and levees reflects evolving federal roles, changing attitudes toward rivers, and the long-term consequences of infrastructure built for conditions that no longer exist.

| **Rationale** | Settle the West, expand agriculture |
| **Philosophy** | "Reclaim" arid lands |

### Flood Control Era (1936-1970)

| Focus | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Primary purpose** | Protect communities from flooding |
| **Federal role** | Build dams and levees nationwide |
| **Rationale** | Post-Depression employment, development |
| **Philosophy** | Control and manage rivers |

### Environmental Era (1970-Present)

| Focus | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Primary purpose** | Balance multiple uses |
| **Federal role** | Operate existing, limited new construction |
| **Rationale** | Environmental protection, cost concerns |
| **Philosophy** | Sustainable water management |
