# Infrastructure Maintenance and Repair: Solutions

## Overview

Addressing the infrastructure maintenance backlog requires sustained funding increases, reformed governance, improved asset management, and aligned incentives. Solutions must overcome political bias toward new construction, close funding gaps, and build institutional capacity for long-term stewardship. A comprehensive approach combines policy reform, funding mechanisms, and management improvements.
