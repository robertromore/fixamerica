# Infrastructure Maintenance and Repair: Overview

America faces a crisis of deferred maintenance across all infrastructure categories. Decades of underinvestment have created a backlog exceeding $2 trillion, with roads, bridges, water systems, schools, and public buildings deteriorating faster than they can be repaired. This maintenance deficit increases lifecycle costs, reduces service quality, threatens safety, and creates economic drag. Addressing the backlog requires sustained investment, better asset management practices, and reformed governance that prioritizes preservation over new construction.
