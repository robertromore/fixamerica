# Infrastructure Maintenance and Repair: Current State

## Overview

America's infrastructure maintenance backlog exceeds $2 trillion and grows annually. Every infrastructure category shows a gap between actual and optimal maintenance spending, with consequences ranging from increased costs to safety failures. The current state reflects decades of deferred maintenance driven by political, fiscal, and institutional factors.
