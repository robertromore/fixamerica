# Infrastructure Maintenance and Repair: Opposition Analysis

## Overview

While few openly oppose infrastructure maintenance in principle, significant opposition exists to the specific policies, funding mechanisms, and institutional changes needed to address the maintenance backlog. This opposition comes from economic interests preferring new construction, fiscal conservatives concerned about spending, and political dynamics that make maintenance less attractive than expansion.

## Construction Industry Preference

### New Construction Bias

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Profit margins** | New construction typically more profitable |
| **Project scale** | Larger projects preferred |
| **Design fees** | New design more lucrative than repair |
| **Equipment utilization** | Heavy equipment for major projects |

|--------------|----------|-----------|
| **AGC** | Support all infrastructure, prefer capital | Significant |
| **ARTBA** | Highway construction focus | Strong |
| **NAHB** | Development infrastructure | Moderate |
| **Engineering firms** | Design work preference | Moderate |

### Argument Patterns

| Argument | Reality |
|----------|---------|
| "New infrastructure creates growth" | Maintenance prevents decline |
| "Construction creates more jobs" | Maintenance labor-intensive per dollar |
| "Modernization requires new facilities" | Rehabilitation achieves similar outcomes |
| "Federal role is capital investment" | Arbitrary historical distinction |

## Fiscal Conservative Opposition
