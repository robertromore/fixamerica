# Aviation Infrastructure: Stakeholders

## Overview

Aviation infrastructure involves diverse stakeholders with often conflicting interests: airlines seeking to control costs, airports needing investment authority, the FAA managing safety and operations, communities affected by noise and emissions, and passengers demanding better service. Understanding these dynamics is essential for building reform coalitions.
