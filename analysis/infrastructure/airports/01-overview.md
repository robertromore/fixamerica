# Aviation Infrastructure: Overview

## Executive Summary

America's aviation infrastructure—airports, air traffic control, and support facilities—faces capacity constraints, modernization needs, and funding challenges. While the U.S. has the world's largest aviation system, decades of underinvestment have left many airports outdated and air traffic control technology behind international standards. Climate change, growing demand, and evolving aircraft technology require strategic investment to maintain competitiveness and connectivity.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Commercial airports**: Passenger terminals, runways, taxiways
- **Air traffic control**: FAA modernization, NextGen
- **General aviation**: Smaller airports and facilities
- **Cargo operations**: Freight infrastructure
- **Airport access**: Ground transportation connections
- **Environmental impacts**: Noise, emissions, community effects

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Commercial airports** | ~500 | Primary and commercial service |
| **Total airports** | ~5,000 | Public-use airports |
| **Annual passengers** | ~900 million | Pre-pandemic peak |
| **Cargo volume** | ~40 billion tons | Growing sector |
| **Infrastructure grade** | D+ | ASCE Report Card |
| **AIP funding** | ~$3.4 billion/year | Federal grants |
| **Backlog** | $115+ billion | Capital needs |

## Scale of the Challenge

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Capacity** | Major hubs near limits |
| **Terminal condition** | Many outdated |
| **Air traffic control** | Modernization delayed |
| **Small airports** | Funding challenges |
| **Sustainability** | Emissions growth concern |

## Problem Statement

American aviation infrastructure faces interconnected challenges:

1. **Capacity constraints**: Delays at major airports
2. **Aging terminals**: Dated facilities, poor experience
3. **ATC modernization**: NextGen behind schedule
4. **Funding gaps**: Passenger fees inadequate
5. **Climate impact**: Emissions growing
6. **Access** : Poor ground transportation
7. **Regional service**: Small community connectivity

## Root Causes Summary

| Cause | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **Funding constraints** | PFC cap, AIP limitations |
| **Political interference** | FAA reauthorization delays |
| **Fragmented ownership** | Local airport authority |
| **NIMBYism** | Expansion opposition |
| **Technology lag** | ATC modernization slow |
| **Climate neglect** | Sustainability underprioritized |

## Solution Directions

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Investment increase** | Higher PFCs, AIP funding |
| **ATC modernization** | Complete NextGen |
| **Sustainable aviation** | SAF, electric aircraft |
| **Regional connectivity** | Essential air service |
| **Ground access** | Transit connections |
| **Noise mitigation** | Community protection |

## Stakeholder Landscape

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|-------------|----------|
| **Airlines** | Operational efficiency, costs |
| **Airport authorities** | Funding, capacity |
| **FAA** | Safety, system management |
| **Passengers** | Experience, cost |
| **Communities** | Noise, access, jobs |
| **Cargo carriers** | Freight capacity |
| **General aviation** | Small airport access |
| **Environmental groups** | Emissions, noise |

## Why This Matters

| Impact | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| **Economic** | Aviation supports $1.7 trillion GDP |
| **Connectivity** | Essential for business, tourism |
| **Competitiveness** | International hub status |
| **Jobs** | Millions employed in aviation |
| **Equity** | Small community access |
| **Climate** | 2-3% of global emissions |
