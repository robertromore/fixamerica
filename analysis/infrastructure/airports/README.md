# Aviation Infrastructure: Overview

America's aviation infrastructure—airports, air traffic control, and support facilities—faces capacity constraints, modernization needs, and funding challenges. While the U.S. has the world's largest aviation system, decades of underinvestment have left many airports outdated and air traffic control technology behind international standards. Climate change, growing demand, and evolving aircraft technology require strategic investment to maintain competitiveness and connectivity.
