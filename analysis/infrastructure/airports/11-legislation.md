SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION.

There is authorized $5 billion annually for
ATC modernization.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act takes effect upon enactment.

### Sustainable Aviation Act

**Purpose**: Accelerate aviation decarbonization.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Sustainable Aviation
Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
    (1) aviation contributes 2-3% of global
    greenhouse gas emissions;
    (2) emissions are projected to grow without
    intervention;
    (3) sustainable aviation fuel can reduce
    lifecycle emissions by up to 80%;
    (4) federal support is needed for transition.

SEC. 3. SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL.

(a) PRODUCTION TARGET.—SAF shall constitute—
    (1) 10% of jet fuel by 2030;
    (2) 30% of jet fuel by 2040;
    (3) 50% of jet fuel by 2050.

(b) PRODUCTION INCENTIVES.—
    (1) Tax credit of $1.75 per gallon for SAF
    meeting sustainability criteria.
    (2) Grant program for SAF production facilities.

(c) INFRASTRUCTURE.—$500 million for SAF blending
and distribution infrastructure at airports.

SEC. 4. AIRPORT SUSTAINABILITY.

(a) GRANTS.—$1 billion annually for airport
sustainability projects including—
    (1) renewable energy;

| **ATC delays** | Efficiency loss | Funding uncertainty |
| **Regional service** | Connectivity gaps | Economics |
| **Sustainability** | Emissions growth | Technology limits |

### Rectification Procedures

2. **Stable ATC funding** through long-term authorization
3. **Acquisition reform** for technology procurement
4. **EAS modernization** with alternative service models
5. **SAF mandates** with production incentives
6. **Ground access requirements** for major airports
7. **Noise mitigation** funding increases
