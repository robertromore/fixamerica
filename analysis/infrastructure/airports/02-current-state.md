# Aviation Infrastructure: Current State

## Overview

American aviation infrastructure encompasses the world's largest airport system but faces aging facilities, capacity constraints, and modernization challenges. While passenger numbers have recovered to near pre-pandemic levels, infrastructure investment has not kept pace with demand. Air traffic control modernization continues to lag, and sustainability concerns add new urgency to system transformation.
