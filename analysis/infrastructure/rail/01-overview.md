# Rail Infrastructure: Overview

## Executive Summary

America's rail network encompasses two distinct systems: the world's most efficient freight rail network and an underdeveloped passenger rail system that lags far behind international peers. While Class I freight railroads move 40% of intercity freight ton-miles and largely fund their own infrastructure, passenger rail—particularly Amtrak—relies on aging infrastructure, inadequate funding, and shared track that creates operational conflicts. High-speed rail, common in Europe and Asia, barely exists in the United States. This document examines the current state of American rail, the policy choices that produced it, and pathways to modernization.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Freight rail**: Class I railroads, short lines, intermodal connections
- **Intercity passenger rail**: Amtrak, state-supported corridors
- **High-speed rail**: Current projects, international comparisons
- **Commuter rail**: Regional transit systems
- **Infrastructure**: Track, bridges, tunnels, stations, equipment
- **Safety**: Derailments, grade crossings, hazardous materials
- **Regulatory framework**: Surface Transportation Board, FRA

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total rail miles** | ~140,000 miles |
| **Freight ton-miles** | 1.7 trillion annually |
| **Amtrak ridership** | ~32 million annually (pre-pandemic) |
| **Amtrak route miles** | ~21,400 miles |
| **Grade crossings** | ~130,000 public crossings |
| **Annual freight rail investment** | $25+ billion (private) |
| **Annual Amtrak federal subsidy** | ~$2 billion |

## The Two-System Challenge

### Freight Rail: Private Success

| Strength | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Efficiency** | Most cost-effective freight mode for bulk, distance |
| **Private investment** | Railroads fund own infrastructure |
| **Intermodal growth** | Container traffic expanding |
| **Safety improvement** | Declining accident rates |

### Passenger Rail: Public Struggle

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Shared track** | Passenger trains use freight routes |
| **On-time performance** | Freight delays passenger service |
| **Speed limitations** | Most corridors under 80 mph |
| **Funding inadequacy** | Chronic underinvestment |
| **Infrastructure age** | Northeast Corridor: century-old tunnels |

## International Comparison

| Country | HSR Miles | Top Speed | Annual Ridership |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| **China** | 26,000+ | 220 mph | 2+ billion |
| **Spain** | 2,100+ | 193 mph | 28 million |
| **France** | 1,700+ | 200 mph | 117 million |
| **Japan** | 1,900+ | 200 mph | 350+ million |
| **United States** | ~34 | 150 mph | 12 million (Acela) |

## Core Problems

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Freight-passenger conflict** | Delays, limited expansion |
| **Infrastructure age** | Tunnels, bridges at end of life |
| **No HSR network** | Competitive disadvantage |
| **Grade crossing danger** | ~2,000 incidents annually |
| **Regulatory fragmentation** | FRA, STB, state agencies |
| **Funding structure** | Passenger rail underfunded |

## Stakeholder Overview

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|-------------|----------|
| **Class I railroads** | Freight efficiency, limited passenger |
| **Amtrak** | Service expansion, infrastructure |
| **States** | Corridor development |
| **Labor unions** | Jobs, safety, work rules |
| **Shippers** | Reliable, affordable freight |
| **Passengers** | Better service, speed |
| **Communities** | Safety, access, noise |

## Reform Opportunities

| Opportunity | Potential |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Infrastructure investment** | Modernize aging assets |
| **Dedicated passenger track** | Separate from freight |
| **High-speed corridors** | Connect major cities |
| **Grade crossing elimination** | Safety, efficiency |
| **Equipment modernization** | New trains, technology |
| **Regulatory reform** | Streamlined processes |
