# Rail Infrastructure: History

## Overview

American rail history reflects a dramatic arc from world leadership to relative decline in passenger service while maintaining freight dominance. The choices made during rail's evolution—particularly the decision to prioritize highways and airlines over passenger rail—continue to shape infrastructure policy today.
