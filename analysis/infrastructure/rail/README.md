# Rail Infrastructure: Overview

America's rail network encompasses two distinct systems: the world's most efficient freight rail network and an underdeveloped passenger rail system that lags far behind international peers. While Class I freight railroads move 40% of intercity freight ton-miles and largely fund their own infrastructure, passenger rail—particularly Amtrak—relies on aging infrastructure, inadequate funding, and shared track that creates operational conflicts. High-speed rail, common in Europe and Asia, barely exists in the United States. This document examines the current state of American rail, the policy choices that produced it, and pathways to modernization.
