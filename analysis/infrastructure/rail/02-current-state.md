# Rail Infrastructure: Current State

## Overview

American rail infrastructure operates as a dual system where highly efficient private freight railroads share track with an underfunded public passenger service. This arrangement produces world-class freight performance but mediocre passenger rail that cannot compete with driving or flying for most trips.
