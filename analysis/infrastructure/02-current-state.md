# Infrastructure Policy: Current State

## Overview

America's infrastructure is in a state of managed decline. While recent federal investment through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) has begun to address urgent needs, decades of underinvestment have created a backlog that will take sustained commitment to resolve. Conditions vary dramatically by sector, geography, and ownership.
