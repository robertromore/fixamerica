# Infrastructure Policy: Solutions

## Overview

Solving America's infrastructure challenges requires addressing funding sustainability, prioritizing maintenance, building resilience, closing equity gaps, and reforming governance. These solutions span federal, state, and local action.

## Funding Reform

### Replace the Gas Tax

| Option | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Vehicle miles traveled (VMT)** | Per-mile fee, captures all vehicles |
| **Road user charge** | Similar to VMT with congestion pricing |
| **Indexed gas tax** | Tie to inflation or construction costs |
| **General fund** | Broader tax base, less user-pays |

### VMT Implementation

| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Technology** | GPS, odometer, or hybrid |
| **Privacy** | Non-tracking options |
| **Collection** | At pump, annual, real-time |
| **Equity** | Rural, low-income adjustments |
| **Phasing** | Pilot, then expand |

### Diversify Revenue

| Source | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Congestion pricing** | High-demand facilities |
| **Value capture** | Transit-oriented development |
| **Impact fees** | New development |
| **Carbon revenue** | Climate nexus |
| **Public-private partnerships** | Appropriate projects |

## Fix-It-First Approach

### Prioritize Maintenance

| Reform | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Maintenance incentives** | Federal match for repair |
| **Performance standards** | Condition-based allocation |
| **Asset management requirements** | Data-driven decisions |
| **Deferred maintenance penalties** | Accountability for neglect |

### Lifecycle Cost Analysis

| Element | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Total cost accounting** | Initial + maintenance + replacement |
| **Require for federal projects** | Grant conditions |
| **Training** | State/local capacity |
| **Standard methodologies** | Consistency |

### State of Good Repair

| Sector | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **Bridges** | Eliminate structural deficiency |
| **Transit** | Address maintenance backlog |
| **Water** | Lead pipe replacement |
| **Roads** | Reduce poor conditions |

## Climate Resilience

### Adaptation Investment

| Action | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Updated design standards** | Future climate, not historic |
| **Vulnerability assessment** | All major systems |
| **Resilience criteria** | In project selection |
| **Hardening investments** | Flood, heat, storm protection |

### Specific Measures

| Infrastructure | Adaptation |
|----------------|------------|
| **Roads** | Heat-resistant materials, drainage |
| **Bridges** | Scour protection, elevated design |
| **Water** | Drought planning, flood resilience |
| **Coastal** | Sea level rise adaptation |
| **Rail** | Heat-resistant rails, grade separation |

### Managed Retreat

| Context | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Repeated flood damage** | Buyouts, relocation |
| **Sea level rise exposure** | Planned withdrawal |
| **Fire risk areas** | Infrastructure limits |
| **Cost-benefit** | When repair exceeds replacement |

## Equity and Access

### Address Historic Disinvestment

| Reform | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Equity criteria** | Federal grant scoring |
| **Reconnecting communities** | Highway removal/redesign |
| **Universal broadband** | Close digital divide |
| **Transit investment** | Non-car access |

### Geographic Equity

| Dimension | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| **Rural** | Base funding levels, broadband priority |
| **Tribal** | Direct funding, consultation |
| **Small systems** | Technical assistance, capacity |
| **Environmental justice** | Pollution reduction, access |

### Affordability

| Service | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| **Broadband** | Affordability programs, competition |
| **Water** | Low-income assistance |
| **Transit** | Reduced fares, service levels |
| **Tolling** | Equity programs |

## Governance Reform

### Reduce Fragmentation

| Reform | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Regional coordination** | MPO strengthening |
| **Cross-modal planning** | Integrated systems |
| **Federal consolidation** | Reduce program overlap |
| **State coordination** | Interagency requirements |

### Performance Management

| Element | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| **Outcome metrics** | Safety, condition, access |
| **Accountability** | Consequences for poor performance |
| **Transparency** | Public reporting |
| **Evidence-based** | Data-driven allocation |

### Streamlined Delivery

| Reform | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **NEPA efficiency** | Faster review without weakening |
| **Concurrent review** | Parallel processes |
| **Categorical exclusions** | Routine projects |
| **Programmatic agreements** | Reduce repetition |
| **One federal decision** | Coordinated timeline |

## Sector-Specific Solutions

### Transportation

| Solution | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **Multimodal investment** | Balance across modes |
| **Complete streets** | All users |
| **Safety focus** | Vision Zero |
| **Freight optimization** | Efficient goods movement |

### Water

| Solution | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **Lead pipe replacement** | Accelerated timeline |
| **System consolidation** | Small system support |
| **Rate sustainability** | Full cost recovery |
| **Green infrastructure** | Stormwater management |

### Broadband

| Solution | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **Universal service** | Coverage obligation |
| **Municipal option** | Enable local networks |
| **Competition policy** | Open access, pole attachment |
| **Affordability** | Subsidy programs |

### Dams and Levees

| Solution | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **Safety investment** | High-hazard priority |
| **Removal where appropriate** | Cost-benefit, ecology |
| **Ownership clarity** | Orphan dam solutions |
| **Inspection resources** | Adequate oversight |

## International Models

### What Works Abroad

| Country | Lesson |
|---------|--------|
| **Germany** | Long-term planning, maintenance culture |
| **Japan** | Seismic resilience, rail investment |
| **Netherlands** | Water management, climate adaptation |
| **Singapore** | Congestion pricing, transit integration |
| **Canada** | Infrastructure bank model |

### Cost Comparison

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| **U.S. costs 2-4x higher** | Procurement, labor, process reform |
| **Other countries build more per dollar** | Efficiency gains possible |
| **Design-build** | Faster, often cheaper |
| **Standardization** | Reduce custom engineering |

## Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Considerations |
|-----------|----------------|
| **New vs. repair** | Political preference vs. efficiency |
| **User fees vs. general tax** | Equity vs. sustainability |
| **Speed vs. review** | Efficiency vs. protection |
| **Federal vs. state** | Standards vs. flexibility |
| **Public vs. private** | Accountability vs. capital |
