### Terminology Update: "Faith Level" → "Engagement Consistency"

**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Priority:** Medium

**Background:** The "Faith Level" scoring in political perspectives analysis documents was reframed to "Engagement Consistency" to avoid adversarial motive-attribution that undermines coalition-building credibility. This change was implemented in the ICS proposal's 30-perspectives.md and should be applied project-wide.

**Changes Required:**

1. **Update template file:**
   - `docs/templates/12-perspectives.md`

2. **Update existing perspective files (26 files):**

   | Domain | Files |
   |--------|-------|
   | `analysis/political/` | campaign-finance, administrative-reform, budget-process |
   | `analysis/aging/` | root + social-security, long-term-care, caregiving-workforce, elder-abuse, dementia, end-of-life, senior-poverty, geriatric-workforce, technology |
   | `analysis/agriculture/` | root + competition-and-regulation, conservation-program-delivery, energy-and-circular-economy, farm-finance-and-land-access, farm-labor-equity, nutrition-and-food-security, rural-infrastructure, soil-health, supply-chain-resilience, technology-and-innovation-policy, trade-and-exports, water-and-climate |

**Terminology Mapping:**

| Old Term | New Term |
|----------|----------|
| Faith Level | Engagement Consistency |
| Full Good Faith (5) | Highly Consistent (5) |
| Mostly Good Faith (4) | Mostly Consistent (4) |
| Mixed Faith (3) | Mixed Consistency (3) |
| Mostly Bad Faith (2) | Low Consistency (2) |
| Full Bad Faith (1) | Unpredictable (1) |
| Bad Faith Indicators | Coalition-Building Considerations |
| Bad Faith Actors | Managing Structural Opposition |
| Good Faith Ratio | Consistency Ratio |
| Faith Level Distribution | Engagement Consistency Distribution |

**Rationale:** "Engagement Consistency" measures predictability as a negotiating partner rather than attributing motives. This framing:
- Focuses on observable behavior patterns
- Avoids adversarial labeling
- Maintains analytical utility while supporting coalition-building goals
